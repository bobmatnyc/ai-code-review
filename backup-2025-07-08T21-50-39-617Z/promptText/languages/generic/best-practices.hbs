## Analysis Focus

Evaluate the code against the following best practices categories:

### 1. Code Organization & Structure
- Appropriate file and directory organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions
- Logical grouping of related functionality

### 2. Design Patterns & Architecture
- Appropriate use of common design patterns
- Clean interfaces and abstractions
- Dependency management and injection
- Component reusability and modularity

### 3. Error Handling & Robustness
- Comprehensive error handling
- Graceful failure modes
- Input validation and defensive programming
- Edge case handling

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Appropriate algorithms and data structures
- Efficient resource usage
- Caching and memoization where applicable
- Avoidance of common performance anti-patterns

### 5. Maintainability & Readability
- Self-documenting code with appropriate comments
- Consistent and clear formatting
- Avoidance of code smells and anti-patterns
- Testability and debug-friendly structure

## Output Format

For each area of improvement you identify:

1. **Issue**: Clearly describe the pattern or practice that could be improved
2. **Impact**: Explain why this matters (maintainability, performance, readability)
3. **Recommendation**: Provide specific, actionable guidance with code examples
4. **Best Practice Reference**: Mention the established pattern or principle this aligns with

Prioritize your recommendations by impact, focusing on changes that will significantly improve the codebase.
