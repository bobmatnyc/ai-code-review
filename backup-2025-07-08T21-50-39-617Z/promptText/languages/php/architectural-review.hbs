## ‚úÖ PHP Architectural Evaluation Checklist

### üèóÔ∏è Code Structure & Organization
- Is the code organized in a logical, maintainable way following PSR standards?
- Is there proper separation of concerns with appropriate modularity?
- Does the project structure follow PHP package conventions (composer.json, autoloading, etc.)?
- Are there appropriate uses of classes, interfaces, and traits?
- Does the directory structure follow best practices for PHP projects (app/, src/, tests/, etc.)?
- Are there opportunities to improve the overall architecture?

### üêò PHP-Specific Patterns
- Is the code making appropriate use of PHP 8.x features when available?
- Are there proper uses of namespaces to avoid conflicts?
- Is there consistent use of typing (strict_types, type hints, return types)?
- Are PHP traits, interfaces, and abstract classes used effectively?
- For frameworks (Laravel, Symfony, etc.), are framework-specific patterns followed?

### üîÑ API Design
- Are APIs well-designed and consistent with PHP conventions?
- For web APIs, are they RESTful or following GraphQL best practices?
- Is there appropriate error handling with proper exception hierarchies?
- Are there clear method signatures with appropriate parameter and return types?
- Are there clear PHPDoc blocks for public interfaces?

### üì¶ Package & Dependency Management
- Is Composer used effectively for dependency management?
- Are dependencies properly specified in composer.json?
- Are there any unnecessary or redundant dependencies?
- Is there a clear strategy for managing package versions?
- Are dev dependencies properly separated from production ones?
- Are there opportunities to leverage established OSS packages (loggers, utilities, etc.) to enhance the codebase or replace custom-built features?

### üß© Component Architecture
- Are components properly decomposed and reusable?
- Is there a clear pattern for component composition?
- Are there appropriate abstractions for common functionality?
- Is state management handled appropriately?
- Is there proper use of dependency injection?

### üîå Integration Points
- Are integrations with external systems well-designed?
- Is there appropriate error handling for external dependencies?
- Are there clear boundaries between the application and external systems?
- Is there proper handling of asynchronous operations where needed?

### üîÑ Data Flow
- Is data flow through the application clear and traceable?
- Are there appropriate data transformation layers?
- Is there a consistent approach to data validation?
- Is there proper separation of database access concerns (repositories, models, etc.)?

### üß© Dependency Management
- Are module dependencies well-organized and appropriate?
- Are there circular dependencies that should be refactored?
- Are there highly coupled modules that should be decoupled?
- Is the external dependency usage optimal and following PHP best practices?

### üìä PHP Ecosystem & Version Compatibility
- Is the project using an appropriate PHP version for its requirements?
- Are there compatibility issues between the PHP version and framework/libraries?
- Would upgrading PHP versions (e.g., to PHP 8.1+, 8.2+) provide meaningful benefits?
- Are dependencies compatible with each other and the PHP version?
- For frameworks (Laravel, Symfony, etc.), is the project using an appropriate version?
- Are there any PHP extensions required that might cause compatibility issues?
- Is the project leveraging appropriate PHP ecosystem tools (Composer, PHPUnit, etc.)?

### üîí Security & Health Analysis
- Are there any known security vulnerabilities in the current PHP dependencies?
- Are there outdated packages with critical security issues?
- Are there unmaintained or abandoned PHP libraries being used?
- Is the application following PHP security best practices?
- Are there any patterns that could lead to security issues (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)?
- Is the project using secure coding practices for sensitive operations?
- Are proper input validation and sanitization techniques being used?

## üì§ Output Format
Provide clear, structured feedback grouped by the checklist categories above. Include:

1. **Strengths**: What architectural aspects are well-implemented
2. **Areas for Improvement**: Identified architectural issues
3. **Recommendations**: Specific suggestions with code examples where appropriate (these are suggestions only, not automatic fixes)
4. **High-Level Architecture Diagram**: A text-based representation of the current or recommended architecture
5. **Dependency Analysis** (if provided): Interpret and highlight key insights from the dependency analysis, including notable circular dependencies, highly coupled modules, and recommendations for improvement
6. **PHP Ecosystem Insights**: Provide specific recommendations regarding:
   - PHP version upgrades (with clear benefits and migration considerations)
   - Framework version updates where applicable
   - Dependency security concerns
   - PHP extension requirements or compatibility issues

When providing PHP ecosystem and version recommendations:
- Specify exact version numbers (e.g., PHP 8.2.5, Laravel 10.x)
- Note specific benefits of newer PHP versions (e.g., readonly properties in PHP 8.1)
- Highlight any breaking changes or migration challenges with version upgrades
- Consider the hosting environment and deployment constraints
- Recommend stable, well-supported PHP ecosystem tools and frameworks
- Address security implications of outdated dependencies

Focus on high-level architectural concerns rather than implementation details or code style issues. Make specific reference to PHP best practices, design patterns, and community standards where appropriate.

NOTE: Your suggestions are for manual implementation by the developer. This tool does not automatically apply fixes - it only provides recommendations that developers must review and implement themselves.
