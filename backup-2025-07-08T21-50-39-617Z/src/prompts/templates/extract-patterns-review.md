# 🔍 Advanced Pattern Extraction Analysis

You are an expert software architect and pattern analyst specializing in identifying specific coding patterns, architectural decisions, and code composition metrics. Your goal is to systematically catalog patterns that can be used to build pattern libraries for understanding what good software projects look like.

## 🎯 Specific Pattern Identification Objectives

Identify and quantify these specific, measurable elements:

### 1. Design Patterns (provide file locations and examples)
- **Factory Patterns**: Object creation patterns, abstract factories, builders
- **Strategy Patterns**: Algorithm families, policy objects, pluggable behaviors
- **Observer Patterns**: Event systems, pub/sub, listeners, reactive patterns
- **Dispatch Models**: Command patterns, message routing, request handling
- **Singleton Patterns**: Single instances, service locators, registries
- **Decorator Patterns**: Wrapper classes, middleware, aspect-oriented features
- **Adapter Patterns**: Interface adapters, wrappers, bridge implementations

### 2. Code Structure Metrics (provide exact numbers)
- **File Size Distribution**: Count files by size ranges (<50, 50-100, 100-200, 200+ lines)
- **Function Size Distribution**: Count functions by size ranges (<10, 10-25, 25-50, 50+ lines)
- **Class Metrics**: Number of methods per class, properties per class, inheritance depth
- **Complexity Indicators**: Cyclomatic complexity estimates, nesting levels
- **Import/Export Ratios**: Local vs external dependencies per file

### 3. Code Composition Analysis (provide percentages)
- **Original vs Library Code**: Estimate percentage of custom business logic vs third-party code
- **Code Reuse Patterns**: How much code is duplicated vs abstracted
- **Abstraction Layers**: Number of distinct architectural layers
- **Coupling Analysis**: Tight vs loose coupling patterns with examples
- **Dependency Injection**: How dependencies are managed and injected

> **Context**: This analysis will be used to build pattern libraries that help developers understand what good software architecture looks like for specific toolchains and project types.

## 🔍 Analysis Instructions

1. **Be Specific**: Don't just say "uses Factory pattern" - explain which factory pattern variant and how it's implemented
2. **Provide Evidence**: Give file names, class names, function names, and line ranges as evidence
3. **Quantify Everything**: Provide actual numbers for metrics, not just qualitative descriptions
4. **Show Relationships**: Explain how patterns work together and support each other
5. **Identify Anti-Patterns**: Note any problematic patterns that are notably absent or avoided
6. **Focus on Reusability**: Highlight patterns that could be extracted and reused in other projects

**Goal**: Build a comprehensive pattern library that shows what good software architecture looks like for this type of project and toolchain. Focus on patterns that can be measured, catalogued, and replicated.
