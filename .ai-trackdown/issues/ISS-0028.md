# **[T-002]** Optimize Build Performance and Memory Usage

**Type:** Task  
**Epic:** EP-001 Project Management & Workflow  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Assignee:** @project-claude  
**Status:** Ready  
**Sprint:** 1  

### Task Description
Further optimize the TypeScript compilation process to improve build performance and reduce memory usage for the large ai-code-review codebase (240+ TypeScript files, 427K+ tokens).

Current optimizations implemented:
- Incremental compilation with `.tsbuildinfo`
- Memory limit increased to 8GB via `NODE_OPTIONS`
- `skipLibCheck` enabled

Additional optimizations needed to improve developer experience and CI/CD performance.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Build time reduced by at least 25%
- [ ] Memory usage stabilized below 6GB during compilation
- [ ] Incremental builds work reliably
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline build time improved
- [ ] Developer productivity enhanced

### Technical Requirements
- TypeScript 5.8.3 compiler optimization
- pnpm package manager efficiency
- Node.js memory management
- Build cache optimization
- Dependency tree optimization

### Steps to Complete
1. Analyze current build performance metrics:
   - Time `pnpm run build:types`
   - Monitor memory usage during compilation
   - Profile TypeScript compiler performance
2. Implement project references for modular compilation:
   - Split large project into logical modules
   - Create separate tsconfig files for major components
3. Optimize dependency management:
   - Review and remove unused dependencies
   - Analyze bundle size and import patterns
   - Consider lazy loading for optional features
4. Enhance build caching:
   - Optimize `.tsbuildinfo` usage
   - Consider additional caching strategies
   - Evaluate build tool alternatives (esbuild, swc)
5. Configure development vs production builds:
   - Fast development builds without full type checking
   - Full validation for production/CI builds

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Build performance improved and measured
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits
- [ ] Documentation updated with optimization guide
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline updated if needed
- [ ] Developer workflow improved
- [ ] Performance regression tests in place

### Dependencies
- Completion of T-001 (TypeScript build fixes)
- Current package.json script configuration
- CI/CD pipeline requirements

### Risks and Considerations
- Modular compilation might affect IDE experience
- Build optimization could impact type checking thoroughness
- Changes might require developer workflow adjustments
- CI/CD pipeline modifications needed

### Testing/Validation
- Benchmark before/after performance metrics
- Test incremental builds after code changes
- Verify all compilation outputs remain identical
- Check IDE TypeScript performance
- Validate CI/CD pipeline efficiency

### GitHub References
- Performance optimization requests
- Developer experience improvements

### Labels/Tags
- performance | build-system | developer-experience
- optimization | typescript | tooling

**Context:** During the ai-code-review migration, significant memory issues were encountered during TypeScript compilation. While these were resolved with increased memory limits and incremental compilation, further optimization would improve the development experience and reduce CI/CD resource usage.
