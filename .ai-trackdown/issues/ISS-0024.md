## üéØ Core Files

### BACKLOG.md
The **single source of truth** for all project work items. Contains:
- Current sprint work items
- Product backlog with epics and stories
- Completed work items with full history
- Sprint metrics and status tracking

### ROADMAP.md
High-level strategic planning document containing:
- Quarterly goals and epic planning
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Completed milestones
- Future innovation opportunities

### RETROSPECTIVES.md
Sprint retrospectives and continuous improvement tracking:
- What went well / what could be improved
- Action items and process improvements
- Key metrics and team insights
- Quarterly retrospectives

### METRICS.md
Comprehensive project metrics and analytics:
- Current sprint performance
- Historical velocity and quality metrics
- Burndown analysis and trends
- Team productivity indicators

## üè∑Ô∏è Work Item Types and Naming

### Naming Conventions
- **Epics:** EP-XXX (EP-001, EP-002...)
- **User Stories:** US-XXX (US-001, US-002...)
- **Tasks:** T-XXX (T-001, T-002...)
- **Bugs:** BUG-XXX (BUG-001, BUG-002...)
- **Spikes:** SP-XXX (SP-001, SP-002...)

### Status Values
- `Backlog` - Not yet prioritized
- `Ready` - Prioritized and ready for development
- `In Progress` - Currently being worked on
- `In Review` - Under code/design review
- `Testing` - In QA testing phase
- `Done` - Completed and deployed
- `Blocked` - Cannot proceed due to dependencies

### Priority Levels
- `Critical` - Production issues, security vulnerabilities
- `High` - Key features, important bug fixes
- `Medium` - Standard features and improvements
- `Low` - Nice-to-have features, technical debt

## üîÑ Daily Workflow

### Morning Standup
1. Review current sprint section in BACKLOG.md
2. Update task statuses based on progress
3. Identify blockers and dependencies

### During Development
1. Move checkboxes as work progresses
2. Add technical notes and discoveries
3. Update time estimates if significantly off
4. Reference work items in commit messages

### End of Day
1. Commit BACKLOG.md changes with descriptive messages
2. Push updates for team visibility
3. Update any blocked or completed items

## üõ†Ô∏è Automation Scripts

### Status Report Generator
```bash
python trackdown/scripts/status-report.py > weekly-report.md
```

Closes: US-001
References: EP-001
```

### Branch Naming
```
feature/US-001-description

## üìä Metrics and Reporting

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Sprint velocity (story points per sprint)
- Cycle time (Ready to Done)
- Sprint commitment accuracy
- Defect rate (bugs per story points)
- Team productivity indicators

### Automated Reporting
- Daily: Sprint burndown updates
- Weekly: Status reports and velocity tracking
- Monthly: Comprehensive performance review
- Quarterly: Strategic goal assessment

## üéì Best Practices

### Work Item Management
- Keep work items small and focused
- Update status regularly throughout development
- Add technical notes for future reference
- Link related items and dependencies

### Sprint Planning
- Review and groom backlog regularly
- Estimate story points collaboratively
- Set clear sprint goals and success criteria
- Identify risks and dependencies early

### Documentation
- Keep BACKLOG.md as single source of truth
- Update ROADMAP.md with strategic changes
- Document lessons learned in retrospectives
- Maintain accurate metrics for decision making

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Review Current State:** Read through BACKLOG.md and ROADMAP.md
2. **Understand Workflow:** Follow daily workflow process
3. **Create Work Items:** Use templates for new work
4. **Update Regularly:** Keep status current throughout development
5. **Use Automation:** Run scripts for reporting and validation
