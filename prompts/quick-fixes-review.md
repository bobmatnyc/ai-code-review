### 📤 Output Format
Provide clear, structured feedback grouped by priority (High/Medium/Low). For each issue:

1. **Issue**: Brief description of the problem
2. **Location**: File and line number(s)
3. **Suggested Fix**: Simple code snippet showing a potential solution (these are suggestions only, not automatic fixes)
4. **Impact**: Brief explanation of the benefit of fixing this issue

Focus on changes that can be implemented quickly with high impact. Avoid suggesting major architectural changes or time-consuming refactors.

NOTE: Your suggestions are for manual implementation by the developer. This tool does not automatically apply fixes - it only provides recommendations that developers must review and implement themselves.
