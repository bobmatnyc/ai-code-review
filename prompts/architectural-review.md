🧠 **Architectural Code Review Prompt**

Act as a **senior software architect with expertise in TypeScript and modern application development**. Perform an architectural review on the following code. Analyze it using the checklist below. Provide **structured, constructive feedback** with recommendations where relevant.

> **Context**: This is an architectural review focusing on code structure, API design, and package organization.

### ✅ Architectural Evaluation Checklist

#### 🏗️ Code Structure & Organization
- Is the code organized in a logical, maintainable way?
- Are there clear separation of concerns and appropriate modularity?
- Does the directory/file structure follow best practices for the framework/language?
- Are there opportunities to improve the overall architecture?

#### 🔄 API Design
- Are APIs well-designed, consistent, and following RESTful or GraphQL best practices?
- Are endpoints properly named and organized?
- Is there appropriate error handling and status code usage?
- Are there clear contracts (types/interfaces) for request/response objects?

#### 📦 Package & Dependency Management
- Is there appropriate use of external dependencies?
- Are there any unnecessary or redundant dependencies?
- Are dependencies properly versioned and maintained?
- Is there a clear strategy for managing package versions?

#### 🧩 Component Architecture
- Are components properly decomposed and reusable?
- Is there a clear pattern for component composition?
- Are there appropriate abstractions for common functionality?
- Is state management handled appropriately?

#### 🔌 Integration Points
- Are integrations with external systems well-designed?
- Is there appropriate error handling for external dependencies?
- Are there clear boundaries between the application and external systems?

#### 🔄 Data Flow
- Is data flow through the application clear and traceable?
- Are there appropriate data transformation layers?
- Is there a consistent approach to data validation?

### 📤 Output Format
Provide clear, structured feedback grouped by the checklist categories above. Include:
1. **Strengths**: What architectural aspects are well-implemented
2. **Areas for Improvement**: Identified architectural issues
3. **Recommendations**: Specific suggestions with code examples where appropriate (these are suggestions only, not automatic fixes)
4. **High-Level Architecture Diagram**: A text-based representation of the current or recommended architecture

Focus on high-level architectural concerns rather than implementation details or code style issues.

NOTE: Your suggestions are for manual implementation by the developer. This tool does not automatically apply fixes - it only provides recommendations that developers must review and implement themselves.
