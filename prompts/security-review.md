### ✅ Security Evaluation Checklist

#### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- Are authentication mechanisms implemented securely?
- Is authorization properly enforced at all levels?
- Are there any privilege escalation vulnerabilities?
- Is session management implemented securely?

#### 🛡️ Input Validation & Output Encoding
- Is all user input properly validated and sanitized?
- Are there potential injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, Command, etc.)?
- Is output properly encoded to prevent XSS?
- Are file uploads handled securely?

#### 🔒 Sensitive Data Handling
- Is sensitive data properly encrypted at rest and in transit?
- Are there any hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials?
- Is PII handled according to best practices?
- Are proper hashing algorithms used for passwords?

#### 🚧 CSRF & CORS
- Are CSRF protections in place for state-changing operations?
- Is CORS configured securely?
- Are security headers properly implemented?

#### 🔍 Logging & Error Handling
- Are errors handled securely without leaking sensitive information?
- Is logging implemented without capturing sensitive data?
- Are there appropriate audit logs for security-relevant events?

#### 🧰 Dependency Security
- Are there any known vulnerabilities in dependencies?
- Is there a process for updating dependencies with security fixes?

#### 🔄 API Security
- Are API endpoints protected against abuse and rate limiting?
- Is proper authentication enforced for all API calls?
- Are there any insecure direct object references?

### 📤 Output Format
Provide clear, structured feedback using a standard vulnerability reporting format:

1. **Finding**: Title of the security issue
2. **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low/Informational
3. **Location**: File and line number(s)
4. **Description**: Detailed explanation of the vulnerability
5. **Impact**: What could happen if exploited
6. **Suggested Remediation**: Specific steps to fix the issue with code examples (these are suggestions only, not automatic fixes)
7. **References**: Links to relevant security standards or documentation

Focus on actionable security findings with clear remediation steps. Prioritize findings by severity.

NOTE: Your suggestions are for manual implementation by the developer. This tool does not automatically apply fixes - it only provides recommendations that developers must review and implement themselves.
