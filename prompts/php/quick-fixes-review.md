#### üêõ Common PHP Bugs & Issues
- Are there any obvious bugs or logic errors?
- Any potential null/undefined issues or type coercion problems?
- Are there any off-by-one errors or boundary condition issues?
- Any missing error handling for common failure scenarios?
- Are there issues with error reporting or suppression?
- Any potential namespace conflicts or missing imports?

#### üßπ PHP Code Improvements
- Are there any unnecessarily complex code blocks that could be simplified?
- Any redundant or duplicate code that could be consolidated?
- Are there obvious performance bottlenecks (e.g., inefficient loops or database queries)?
- Any hardcoded values that should be constants or configuration?
- Could array functions (array_map, array_filter) be used instead of loops?
- Are proper PHP 8.x features being used when available (match expressions, named arguments, etc.)?

### üì§ Output Format
Provide clear, structured feedback grouped by priority (High/Medium/Low). For each issue:

1. **Issue**: Brief description of the problem
2. **Location**: File and line number(s)
3. **Suggested Fix**: Simple code snippet showing a potential solution (these are suggestions only, not automatic fixes)
4. **Impact**: Brief explanation of the benefit of fixing this issue

Focus on changes that can be implemented quickly with high impact. Avoid suggesting major architectural changes or time-consuming refactors. Include PHP-specific best practices and idioms where appropriate.

NOTE: Your suggestions are for manual implementation by the developer. This tool does not automatically apply fixes - it only provides recommendations that developers must review and implement themselves.
