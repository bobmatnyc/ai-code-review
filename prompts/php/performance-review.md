🧠 **PHP Performance Code Review Prompt**

Act as a **PHP performance optimization expert with deep knowledge of runtime optimization**. Perform a detailed performance review on the following PHP code. Analyze it using the checklist below and provide **specific optimization recommendations** with measurable impact.

> **Context**: This is a performance-focused review to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities in PHP code.

### ✅ PHP Performance Evaluation Checklist

#### 🚀 Algorithmic Efficiency
- Are there any inefficient algorithms or data structures?
- Are there O(n²) or worse operations that could be optimized?
- Are there opportunities for memoization or caching?
- Could any recursive functions be rewritten iteratively?
- Are there any unnecessary computations inside loops?

#### 🐘 PHP-Specific Optimizations
- Are there opportunities to use built-in functions instead of custom code?
- Are array operations optimized (using array_* functions where appropriate)?
- Is the code making use of proper PHP 7/8 features for performance?
- Are appropriate data types and type hints used?
- Is there proper use of references for large data structures where appropriate?

#### 🔄 Opcode Optimization
- Are there opportunities to optimize for PHP's opcode cache?
- Could any template/view code be cached?
- Is autoloading configured efficiently?
- Are any operations performed unnecessarily on each request?

#### 🗄️ Database & Data Management
- Are database queries optimized with proper indexes?
- Are N+1 query problems avoided?
- Is there excessive data fetching (selecting unnecessary columns)?
- Are prepared statements used consistently?
- Is caching used effectively for database results?

#### 🔄 I/O Operations
- Are file I/O operations batched appropriately?
- Is output buffering used where appropriate?
- Are session operations optimized?
- Are external API calls minimized and cached when possible?

#### 🧮 Memory Utilization
- Are there memory leaks from circular references?
- Are objects and arrays properly unset when no longer needed?
- Could any large in-memory structures be reduced?
- Are there issues with memory_limit configuration?

#### 🔌 Framework & Library Usage
- Are there inefficient uses of framework components?
- Is there excessive dependency injection or service location?
- Are there opportunities for lazy loading of services?
- Are framework-specific optimization features used (compiled containers, cached routes, etc.)?

#### 🌐 Web Server Optimization
- Are HTTP caching headers properly utilized?
- Could any content be pre-compiled or cached?
- Is static content served efficiently?
- Are there opportunities for Edge Side Includes (ESI)?

### 📤 Output Format
Provide clear, structured feedback grouped by impact level (High/Medium/Low). For each issue:

1. **Performance Issue**: Description of the performance problem
2. **Location**: File and line number(s)
3. **Current Impact**: Estimated performance cost (with reasoning)
4. **Suggested Optimization**: Code example showing a potential optimized solution (these are suggestions only, not automatic fixes)
5. **Expected Improvement**: Estimated performance gain
6. **Measurement Strategy**: How to verify the improvement (e.g., using Xdebug profiler, Blackfire, etc.)

Focus on practical optimizations with significant impact. Include both quick wins and more substantial optimizations. Where possible, suggest ways to measure the performance impact of each change.

NOTE: Your suggestions are for manual implementation by the developer. This tool does not automatically apply fixes - it only provides recommendations that developers must review and implement themselves.
