### 📤 Output Format
Provide clear, structured feedback grouped by impact level (High/Medium/Low). For each issue:

1. **Unused Code Issue**: Description of the unused code problem
2. **Location**: File and line number(s)
3. **Assessment**: Confidence that this code is truly unused (with reasoning)
4. **Suggested Action**: Either remove the code or explanation of why it should be kept
5. **Risk Level**: Potential impact of removing this code (Low/Medium/High)

Focus on practical recommendations with clear justification. Include both easy fixes and more substantial cleanups.

NOTE: Your suggestions are for manual implementation by the developer. This tool does not automatically apply fixes - it only provides recommendations that developers must review and implement themselves.
