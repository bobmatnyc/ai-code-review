### ✅ Python Security Evaluation Checklist

#### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- Are authentication mechanisms implemented securely?
- Is authorization properly enforced at all levels?
- Are there any privilege escalation vulnerabilities?
- Is session management implemented securely?
- Are secrets and credentials properly protected?

#### 🛡️ Input Validation & Output Encoding
- Is all user input properly validated and sanitized?
- Are there potential injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, Command, etc.)?
- Are there unsafe uses of `eval()`, `exec()`, `os.system()`, `subprocess.call()`, etc.?
- Is there proper handling of file paths and filenames?
- Are file uploads handled securely?

#### 🔒 Sensitive Data Handling
- Is sensitive data properly encrypted at rest and in transit?
- Are there any hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials?
- Is PII handled according to best practices?
- Are proper hashing algorithms used for passwords (e.g., using bcrypt/Argon2)?
- Are there uses of insecure random number generation?

#### 🚧 Web Security (for web applications)
- Are CSRF protections in place for state-changing operations?
- Is CORS configured securely?
- Are security headers properly implemented?
- Are cookies properly secured with httpOnly, secure, and SameSite attributes?
- Is there protection against common web vulnerabilities?

#### 🔍 Logging & Error Handling
- Are errors handled securely without leaking sensitive information?
- Is logging implemented without capturing sensitive data?
- Are there appropriate audit logs for security-relevant events?
- Are exceptions caught and handled properly?

#### 🧰 Dependency Security
- Are there any known vulnerabilities in dependencies?
- Is there a process for updating dependencies with security fixes?
- Are there any insecure or outdated cryptographic libraries?
- Are unsafe serialization/deserialization methods used (pickle, etc.)?

#### 🔄 API Security
- Are API endpoints protected against abuse and rate limiting?
- Is proper authentication enforced for all API calls?
- Are there any insecure direct object references?
- Is appropriate input validation performed on API parameters?

#### 🐍 Python-Specific Security Issues
- Are there uses of unsafe Python functions/methods?
- Is there proper handling of subprocess calls?
- Are there YAML/Pickle/Marshal deserialization vulnerabilities?
- Are temporary files handled securely?
- Are there any uses of insecure and deprecated functions?

### 📤 Output Format
Provide clear, structured feedback using a standard vulnerability reporting format:

1. **Finding**: Title of the security issue
2. **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low/Informational
3. **Location**: File and line number(s)
4. **Description**: Detailed explanation of the vulnerability
5. **Impact**: What could happen if exploited
6. **Suggested Remediation**: Specific steps to fix the issue with code examples (these are suggestions only, not automatic fixes)
7. **References**: Links to relevant security standards or documentation

Focus on actionable security findings with clear remediation steps. Prioritize findings by severity.

NOTE: Your suggestions are for manual implementation by the developer. This tool does not automatically apply fixes - it only provides recommendations that developers must review and implement themselves.
