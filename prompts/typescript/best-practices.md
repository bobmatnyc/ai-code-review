### ‚úÖ Next.js Best Practices Evaluation Checklist

#### üèóÔ∏è TypeScript Configuration and Type Safety
- Analyze the TypeScript configuration with special attention to:
  - Strictness settings (`strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`)
  - Module resolution and import configuration
  - Type definition patterns and practices

- Look for and suggest improvements in:
  - Explicit typing vs. inference for function parameters and returns

  - Error handling patterns
  - Caching strategies

- Look for:
  - Appropriate use of Route Handlers with proper HTTP methods
  - Implementation of Server Actions for form submissions
  - Effective data fetching in Server Components
  - Client-side data fetching with SWR or TanStack Query
  - Error boundary usage around data fetching components
  - Proper loading state management
  - Response caching and revalidation strategies
  - Incremental Static Regeneration usage where appropriate
  - Partial Prerendering implementation

#### üîí Security Best Practices
- Evaluate security measures:
  - Authentication implementation
  - Authorization strategies
  - Data validation
  - Protection against common vulnerabilities

- Check for:

  - Proper authorization checks for protected routes
  - Input validation with Zod or similar
  - CSRF protection for forms and API routes
  - Content Security Policy implementation
  - Secure handling of environment variables
  - Protection against XSS via proper output encoding
  - API rate limiting and protection

#### üß™ Testing Approaches
- Review the testing strategy:
  - Unit test coverage and quality
  - Integration testing approach
  - End-to-end testing implementation
  - Component testing methods

- Look for:
  - Appropriate test framework usage (Vitest, Jest)
  - Component testing with React Testing Library
  - End-to-end testing with Playwright
  - Test organization and structure
  - Mock implementation for external dependencies
  - Testing of error states and edge cases
  - API testing approach

#### ‚ö° Performance Optimization
- Analyze performance considerations:
