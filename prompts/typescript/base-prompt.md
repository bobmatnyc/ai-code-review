DEVELOPER GUIDE: HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

This is a base template for TypeScript code reviews. When creating specialized review prompts:

1. {{SPECIALIZATION}} - Replace with the specific expertise area (e.g., "React", "Node.js", "API design")
   Example: "senior TypeScript developer with expertise in React performance optimization"

2. {{CONTEXT}} - Provide specific context about the review
   Example: "This is a review of a new authentication service using TypeScript and Express"

3. {{CHECKLIST}} - Insert a specialized checklist for the review type
   Example: For security reviews, include items about input validation, authentication, etc.

4. {{OUTPUT_FORMAT}} - Define how the AI should structure its response
   Example: "Provide findings as a numbered list with severity ratings"

5. {{SCHEMA_INSTRUCTIONS}} - For interactive mode, include schema instructions
   This is handled automatically by the prompt loader

Ensure all placeholders are replaced before using this template.
