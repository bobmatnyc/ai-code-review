# Enhanced Dependency Analysis for Architectural and Security Reviews

## Overview

This PR implements enhanced dependency analysis for architectural and security reviews, making it work by default for both review types and adding three key improvements beyond npm audit:

1. **Dependency visualization** using dependency-cruiser
2. **Unused dependency detection** using depcheck
3. **Contextual analysis** of dependencies with project-specific recommendations

## Implementation Details

### Key Features

- **Default Integration**: Dependency analysis now works by default for both architectural and security reviews
- **Better Visualization**: Added dependency visualization with dependency-cruiser, generating both SVG graphs and JSON data
- **Unused Dependency Detection**: Added support for detecting unused dependencies with depcheck
- **Contextual Recommendations**: Provides project-specific recommendations based on the detected tech stack and dependency patterns
- **Improved Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when tools are not available or when errors occur
- **Consistent Output Format**: Enhanced formatting with emojis and better organization of dependency information

### Technical Implementation

1. Created a new `enhancedDependencyAnalyzer.ts` that handles:
   - Detecting tech stacks
   - Finding unused dependencies
   - Running npm audit for security issues
   - Generating dependency visualization
   - Providing contextual recommendations
   - Formatting comprehensive reports

2. Updated `OutputManager.ts` to handle dependency analysis consistently for all review types
   - Added support for both architectural and security reviews
   - Improved JSON structure for machine-readable output
   - Enhanced error handling for all components

3. Modified `architecturalReviewHandler.ts` to use the centralized dependency analysis in OutputManager
   - Removed duplicate code
   - Added better logging
   - Ensured backward compatibility

4. Added comprehensive test scripts:
   - `tests/test-dependency-analysis.js`: For testing the full enhanced analyzer
   - `src/utils/dependencies/test-enhanced-dependency-analysis.ts`: For component testing

## Benefits

1. **Better Developer Experience**: 
   - Dependency analysis is now enabled by default
   - Output is more visually organized and includes actionable recommendations

2. **More Comprehensive Analysis**:
   - Detects unused dependencies that may increase security exposure
   - Visualizes dependency relationships to spot architectural issues
   - Provides contextual recommendations based on project type

3. **Improved Reliability**:
   - Graceful fallbacks when tools or prerequisites are missing
   - Resilient to various JSON output formats from different tools
   - Better error handling throughout the pipeline

## Testing

The enhanced dependency analyzer has been tested on multiple project types including:
- TypeScript/JavaScript projects
- Projects with and without package-lock.json
- Projects with varying dependency structures

## Next Steps

1. Add support for additional language ecosystems (Python pip, Ruby gems, PHP composer)
2. Enhance visualization options 
3. Add custom rule detection for specific dependency patterns

## Screenshots

The enhanced dependency analysis now includes sections for:
