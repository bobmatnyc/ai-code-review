# **[T-003]** Validate Local Project Integration

**Type:** Task  
**Epic:** EP-001 Project Management & Workflow  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Assignee:** @project-claude  
**Status:** Ready  
**Sprint:** 1  

### Task Description
Complete comprehensive testing and validation of the ai-code-review project's local project management integration. Ensure all local project management requirements are met and the project follows self-contained patterns.

Migration completed but requires final validation:
- CLAUDE.md local project configuration
- Operations documentation consistency
- Service responsibility model implementation
- Development workflow alignment with local trackdown system

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CLAUDE.md follows local project configuration standards
- [ ] Operations documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Service responsibility model is clearly defined and working
- [ ] Development workflow aligns with local trackdown patterns
- [ ] Integration with local project tools validated
- [ ] Documentation consistency verified across all files

### Technical Requirements
- Local project configuration compliance
- Documentation standards adherence
- Service architecture alignment
- Integration testing with local tools
- Operational procedures validation

### Steps to Complete
1. Review CLAUDE.md for local project compliance:
   - Service classification accuracy
   - Responsibility model implementation
   - Technical stack documentation
   - Integration points verification
2. Validate operations documentation:
   - Compare with other managed projects
   - Verify completeness of operational procedures
   - Test deployment and management workflows
3. Test service responsibility separation:
   - Verify development vs operations responsibilities
   - Check service lifecycle management
4. Validate development workflow integration:
   - Test with local project tools and processes
   - Verify compatibility with local patterns
   - Check dependency handling
5. Documentation consistency review:
   - Align terminology with project standards
   - Ensure consistency with local trackdown system
   - Update any outdated references or procedures

### Definition of Done
- [ ] CLAUDE.md meets all local project requirements
- [ ] Operations documentation verified and complete
- [ ] Service responsibility model tested and documented
- [ ] Development workflow integration confirmed
- [ ] All documentation updated and consistent
- [ ] Local project compliance checklist completed

### Dependencies
- Local project documentation and standards
- Other managed projects as reference examples
- Local tools and integration requirements

### Risks and Considerations
- Local standards might require significant documentation updates
- Service boundaries might need clarification
- Integration testing might reveal compatibility issues
- Documentation maintenance overhead

### Testing/Validation
- Compare against local project checklist
- Test development workflow with local tools
- Verify operations procedures work as documented
- Check consistency with trackdown system
- Validate service lifecycle management

### GitHub References
- Local project requirements
- Project migration completion
- Related managed project examples

### Labels/Tags
- documentation | framework-integration | compliance
- project-management | standards | validation

**Context:** The ai-code-review project was successfully migrated to use local project management, but requires final validation to ensure complete compliance with local project standards and consistency with other managed projects. This task ensures the integration is complete and follows all established local patterns.
