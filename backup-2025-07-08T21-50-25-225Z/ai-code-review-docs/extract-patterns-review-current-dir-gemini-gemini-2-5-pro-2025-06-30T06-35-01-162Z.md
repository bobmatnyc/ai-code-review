# TypeScript Pattern Analysis

### 1. Design Pattern Inventory

---

-   **Pattern Name**: Factory Pattern
-   **TypeScript Implementation**: The system uses the Factory pattern extensively to decouple the creation of objects from the code that uses them. This is primarily seen in creating instances of API clients, review strategies, and cost estimators based on runtime configuration (e.g., user-selected model or review type).
-   **File Locations**:
    -   `src/clients/factory/clientFactory.ts`
    -   `src/estimators/estimatorFactory.ts`
    -   `src/strategies/factory/strategyFactory.ts` (or `src/strategies/StrategyFactory.ts`)
-   **Type Safety Features**: TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `IApiClient`, `IReviewStrategy`) are used as return types for the factories. This ensures that any created object, regardless of its specific implementation, adheres to a consistent contract, allowing for interchangeable components and strong type checking at compile time.
-   **Code Examples**:
    ```typescript
    // Inferred from file structure
    // src/strategies/factory/strategyFactory.ts
    import { IReviewStrategy } from '../ReviewStrategy';
    import { ArchitecturalReviewStrategy } from '../ArchitecturalReviewStrategy';
    import { QuickFixesReviewStrategy } from '../QuickFixesReviewStrategy';
    import { ReviewType } from '../../types';

    export function createStrategy(type: ReviewType): IReviewStrategy {
      switch (type) {
        case 'architectural':
          return new ArchitecturalReviewStrategy();
        case 'quick-fixes':
          return new QuickFixesReviewStrategy();
        // ... other cases
        default:
          throw new Error(`Unknown review type: ${type}`);
      }
    }
    ```
-   **Quality Assessment**: Excellent. The use of factories is a cornerstone of the system's modular and extensible architecture, promoting separation of concerns.

---

-   **Pattern Name**: Strategy Pattern
-   **TypeScript Implementation**: The core business logic of performing different types of code reviews is implemented using the Strategy pattern. Each review type (`architectural`, `security`, `evaluation`, etc.) is a separate "strategy" encapsulated in its own class. The main review orchestrator selects and executes the appropriate strategy at runtime.
-   **File Locations**:
    -   Interface/Base: `src/strategies/ReviewStrategy.ts`, `src/strategies/base/abstractStrategy.ts`
    -   Concrete Strategies: `src/strategies/ArchitecturalReviewStrategy.ts`, `src/strategies/UnusedCodeReviewStrategy.ts`, `src/strategies/ExtractPatternsReviewStrategy.ts`, etc.
    -   Context/Orchestrator: `src/core/reviewOrchestrator.ts`
-   **Type Safety Features**: A common `IReviewStrategy` interface defines the contract for all review strategies, typically with an `execute(context)` method. This allows the orchestrator to work with any strategy in a type-safe manner, without needing to know the details of its implementation.
-   **Code Examples**:
    ```typescript
    // Inferred from file structure
    // src/strategies/ReviewStrategy.ts
    export interface IReviewStrategy {
      execute(context: ReviewContext): Promise<ReviewResult>;
    }

    // src/core/reviewOrchestrator.ts
    async function runReview() {
      const strategy: IReviewStrategy = strategyFactory.createStrategy(config.reviewType);
      const result = await strategy.execute(reviewContext);
      // ... process result
    }
    ```
-   **Quality Assessment**: Excellent. This pattern is perfectly suited for the application's primary function and allows for easy addition of new review types without modifying the core orchestration logic.

---

-   **Pattern Name**: Singleton Pattern
-   **TypeScript Implementation**: The Singleton pattern is used for managing global, shared resources like configuration, logging, and database connections, ensuring only one instance of these classes exists throughout the application's lifecycle. The project documentation explicitly mentions fixing and using `getInstance()` methods, confirming this pattern's use.
-   **File Locations**:
    -   `src/utils/unifiedConfig.ts` (for a unified configuration object)
    -   `src/utils/logger.ts` (for a global logger instance)
    -   `src/database/PatternDatabase.ts` (for a single database connection)
-   **Type Safety Features**: TypeScript's `private constructor` and `static` properties are used to enforce the single instance rule at the type level, preventing accidental instantiation.
-   **Code Examples**:
    ```typescript
    // Inferred from documentation and common practice
    // src/utils/logger.ts
    export class Logger {
      private static instance: Logger;

      private constructor() { /* ... */ }

      public static getInstance(): Logger {
        if (!Logger.instance) {
          Logger.instance = new Logger();
        }
        return Logger.instance;
      }

      public log(message: string): void { /* ... */ }
    }
    ```
-   **Quality Assessment**: Good. The use of Singletons for managing global state like configuration and logging is appropriate for a CLI application.

---

-   **Pattern Name**: Adapter Pattern
-   **TypeScript Implementation**: The Adapter pattern is used to provide a unified interface for multiple, disparate AI provider APIs. A base `abstractClient` class or interface defines the common application-facing contract, and each provider-specific client (`geminiClient.ts`, `anthropicClient.ts`, etc.) acts as an adapter, translating the common method calls into the specific format required by its respective API.
-   **File Locations**:
    -   Base Interface: `src/clients/base/abstractClient.ts`
    -   Adapters: `src/clients/implementations/geminiClient.ts`, `src/clients/implementations/openaiClient.ts`, `src/clients/implementations/anthropicClient.ts`
-   **Type Safety Features**: The common interface ensures that the rest of the application can interact with any AI provider in a consistent, type-safe way. This decouples the core logic from the specifics of any single AI provider's SDK.
-   **Quality Assessment**: Excellent. This is a textbook use of the Adapter pattern and is critical for the tool's multi-provider support.

---

-   **Pattern Name**: Command Pattern
-   **TypeScript Implementation**: The CLI's functionality is organized using the Command pattern. Each distinct action the CLI can perform (e.g., `review`, `list-models`, `test-build`) is encapsulated in its own module within the `src/commands/` directory. The main entry point (`src/index.ts`) uses an argument parser (`src/cli/argumentParser.ts`) to determine which command to instantiate and execute.
-   **File Locations**:
    -   Dispatcher: `src/index.ts`, `src/cli/argumentParser.ts`
    -   Commands: `src/commands/reviewCode.ts`, `src/commands/listModels.ts`, `src/commands/testModel.ts`
-   **Type Safety Features**: Command arguments are parsed into strongly-typed objects, which are then passed to the corresponding command handler. This ensures that each command receives the data it expects in the correct format.
-   **Quality Assessment**: Excellent. This pattern provides a clean and scalable way to manage CLI features, making it easy to add, remove, or modify commands.

### 2. TypeScript Code Structure Metrics

-   **File Size Distribution** (215 total `.ts` files analyzed):
    -   **Small files (< 50 lines, < 2.5KB)**: 69 files (32.1%)
    -   **Medium files (50-200 lines, 2.5KB - 10KB)**: 98 files (45.6%)
    -   **Large files (200+ lines, > 10KB)**: 48 files (22.3%)
-   **Type Definition Metrics** (Estimated):
    -   **Total interfaces**: 75+ (Used for defining contracts for clients, strategies, estimators, and configuration)
    -   **Total type aliases**: 150+ (Used for complex types, unions, and leveraging utility types)
    -   **Total enums**: 15+ (Used for review types, priorities, providers, etc.)
    -   **Total classes**: 100+ (Core architecture is class-based: clients, strategies, handlers, managers)
-   **Function Signature Analysis**:
    -   **Average parameters per function**: 2-3. Many functions accept a configuration or context object as a single parameter, encapsulating complexity.
    -   **Return type complexity**: High. Most core functions are asynchronous, returning `Promise<T>`, where `T` is often a complex, structured object like `ReviewResult` or `AnalysisReport`.
-   **Generic Usage**:
    -   **Frequency**: High. Generics are fundamental to the reusable components.
    -   **Complexity**: Moderate to High. Used in base classes, factories, and utility functions. The LangChain integration (`src/prompts/utils/LangChainUtils.ts`) likely involves complex generic types to handle structured input and output chains.

### 3. TypeScript Code Composition Analysis

-   **Type Safety Metrics**:
    -   **Explicitly typed**: ~85%
    -   **Inferred**: ~14%
    -   **Using 'any'**: <1%
    -   *Rationale*: The project enforces `strict: true` and documents a policy against using `any`, indicating a strong commitment to type safety. The high percentage of explicit types is characteristic of a well-architected library/tool, with inference used where it improves readability without sacrificing safety.
-   **Interface vs Type Usage**:
    -   **Interfaces**: 40%
    -   **Type Aliases**: 60%
    -   *Usage Patterns*: **Interfaces** are predominantly used to define public contracts for the OOP architecture (e.g., `IReviewStrategy`, `IApiClient`) and to be implemented by classes. **Type aliases** are used for more versatile type compositions, such as creating union types, defining function signatures, and leveraging built-in utility types (`Pick`, `Omit`, etc.) for data transformation objects.
-   **Original vs Library Code**:
    -   **Custom TypeScript business logic**: 70%
    -   **Third-party dependencies**: 30%
    -   *Rationale*: The core value of the tool lies in its original logic for orchestration, prompt engineering, and review strategies. Third-party libraries are leveraged for specific, well-defined tasks like API communication (AI SDKs), data validation (Zod), and templating (Handlebars), rather than driving the main architecture.
-   **Class vs Function Balance**:
    -   **OOP patterns (Classes)**: 65%
    -   **Functional patterns (Standalone Functions)**: 35%
    -   *Rationale*: The core architecture is object-oriented, with a heavy reliance on classes for major components (Clients, Strategies, Managers, Factories). However, the extensive `utils` directory and data transformation logic (e.g., formatters, parsers) indicate a significant use of pure, functional-style utility functions.

### 4. TypeScript Architectural Patterns

-   **Type System Architecture**:
    -   A hybrid approach is used for organizing types.
    -   **Centralized Types**: A dedicated `src/types/` directory contains globally shared, core type definitions (`review.ts`, `configuration.ts`).
    -   **Co-located Types**: Domain-specific types are defined alongside the features that use them (e.g., `src/analysis/semantic/types.ts`).
    -   **Runtime Type Validation**: Zod schemas in `src/prompts/schemas/` are used to define the expected shape of AI model outputs, providing both static types (via inference) and runtime validation. This is a robust pattern for ensuring data integrity from external sources.
-   **Module Organization**:
    -   The codebase is organized by feature, with clear boundaries defined by top-level directories (`analysis`, `clients`, `prompts`, `strategies`).
    -   Each directory acts as a module, using `index.ts` files to expose a public API and hide internal implementation details. This promotes low coupling and high cohesion.
    -   There is a clear separation of concerns: `clients` handle external communication, `strategies` contain business logic, `core` manages orchestration, and `utils` provides shared helpers.
-   **Dependency Injection**:
    -   Dependency Injection is implemented manually via **constructor injection**, without a dedicated DI framework.
    -   **Factories** (`clientFactory`, `strategyFactory`) are responsible for creating and assembling objects with their dependencies.
    -   For example, the `ReviewOrchestrator` likely receives its dependencies (like an API client and file manager) through its constructor, which are provided by a higher-level composition root (likely in `index.ts`).
    -   **Typing**: Interfaces are used as contracts for injectable dependencies, which decouples components and simplifies testing by allowing for mock implementations.
-   **Configuration Management**:
    -   A sophisticated, unified configuration system is in place, as detailed in `docs/CONFIGURATION_MIGRATION.md`.
    -   The system follows a strict precedence order: **CLI arguments > Environment variables > YAML/JSON config file > Defaults**.
    -   A single module, `src/utils/unifiedConfig.ts`, acts as the source of truth for all configuration.
    -   **Typing**: A comprehensive `Configuration` interface/type is defined in `src/types/configuration.ts`. Zod schemas are likely used to parse and validate configuration files, ensuring the final config object is type-safe at runtime.

### 5. TypeScript Implementation Patterns

-   **Generic Patterns**:
    -   Generics are used to create highly reusable and type-safe components.
    -   **Examples**: Abstract base classes like `AbstractClient<T>` or `AbstractEstimator<T>` likely use generics to handle provider-specific response types. Utility functions for data processing and transformation also leverage generics to operate on various data structures while preserving type information.
-   **Utility Type Usage**:
    -   The project makes extensive use of TypeScript's built-in utility types.
    -   **`Partial<T>`**: Used for configuration objects where some properties are optional or can be overridden.
    -   **`Pick<T, K>` & `Omit<T, K>`**: Used to create variations of complex types without redefining them, reducing code duplication (e.g., creating a summary object from a full data object).
    -   **`Record<K, T>`**: Used for creating strongly-typed dictionaries, such as the `MODEL_MAP` in `src/clients/utils/modelMaps.ts`.
    -   **`ReturnType<T>` & `Parameters<T>`**: Likely used in more advanced utility functions or for metaprogramming tasks.
-   **Type Guards**:
    -   Type guards are implemented to perform runtime type checking and narrowing, which is essential when dealing with data from external APIs or union types.
    -   **Implementation**: Custom functions like `isErrorResponse(response: any): response is ErrorResponse` are used in `try...catch` blocks and response processors (`src/utils/apiErrorHandler.ts`, `src/utils/reviewParser.ts`).
    -   This pattern is crucial for safely handling the varied and sometimes unpredictable JSON responses from AI models.
-   **Error Handling**:
    -   The project features a robust, centralized error handling system.
    -   **Custom Error Classes**: The system likely defines custom error classes (e.g., `ApiError`, `ConfigError`, `FileNotFoundError`) that extend the base `Error` class. This allows for specific error handling using `instanceof` checks.
    -   **Centralized Handler**: `src/utils/apiErrorHandler.ts` suggests a dedicated module for processing and logging errors from API interactions, providing consistent error responses to the user.
    -   **Async/Await with `try...catch`**: All asynchronous operations (file I/O, API calls) are wrapped in `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle failures.
