# TypeScript Pattern Analysis

This analysis outlines the design patterns, code structure, and architectural decisions observed in the AI Code Review tool codebase. The assessment is based on the provided file structure, documentation, and naming conventions.

### 1. Design Pattern Inventory

The project effectively uses several classic and modern design patterns, enhanced by TypeScript's type system.

---
- **Pattern Name**: Factory Pattern
- **TypeScript Implementation**: The project uses multiple factories to decouple object creation from the consumers. Generic functions and type mappings are used to ensure type-safe instantiation of different implementations based on configuration or runtime conditions.
- **File Locations**:
  - `src/clients/factory/clientFactory.ts`
  - `src/estimators/estimatorFactory.ts`
  - `src/prompts/strategies/PromptStrategyFactory.ts`
  - `src/strategies/factory/strategyFactory.ts`
- **Type Safety Features**: Factories likely use string literals or enums for keys (e.g., `'gemini'`, `'anthropic'`) which map to specific class constructors. TypeScript ensures that the return type of the factory method matches the expected interface (e.g., `AbstractClient`, `ReviewStrategy`), preventing type errors downstream.
- **Code Examples**:
  ```typescript
  // Inferred from file structure
  // In strategyFactory.ts
  import { ReviewStrategy } from '../ReviewStrategy';
  import { ArchitecturalReviewStrategy } from '../ArchitecturalReviewStrategy';
  import { QuickFixesReviewStrategy } from '../QuickFixesReviewStrategy';

  export class StrategyFactory {
    static create(type: 'architectural' | 'quick-fixes'): ReviewStrategy {
      switch (type) {
        case 'architectural':
          return new ArchitecturalReviewStrategy();
        case 'quick-fixes':
          return new QuickFixesReviewStrategy();
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Quality Assessment**: Excellent. The consistent use of factories for clients, strategies, and estimators demonstrates a strong architectural principle of inversion of control and promotes extensibility.

---
- **Pattern Name**: Strategy Pattern
- **TypeScript Implementation**: The core review logic is implemented using the Strategy pattern. Each review type (`architectural`, `security`, `performance`, etc.) is encapsulated in its own strategy class that conforms to a common `ReviewStrategy` interface. The `reviewOrchestrator.ts` likely uses the `StrategyFactory` to select the appropriate strategy at runtime based on the user's CLI input.
- **File Locations**:
  - `src/strategies/ReviewStrategy.ts` (The base interface)
  - `src/strategies/ArchitecturalReviewStrategy.ts`
  - `src/strategies/MultiPassReviewStrategy.ts`
  - `src/strategies/UnusedCodeReviewStrategy.ts`
  - `src/core/reviewOrchestrator.ts` (The context that uses the strategy)
- **Type Safety Features**: A base `ReviewStrategy` interface defines the contract that all concrete strategies must follow. This allows the orchestrator to work with any strategy through a single, type-safe interface, ensuring methods like `execute()` are always present and have the correct signature.
- **Code Examples**:
  ```typescript
  // Inferred from file structure
  // In reviewOrchestrator.ts
  import { StrategyFactory } from '../strategies/factory/strategyFactory';

  async function runReview(options: ReviewOptions) {
    const strategy = StrategyFactory.create(options.reviewType);
    const reviewResult = await strategy.execute(options.files, options.context);
    // ...
  }
  ```
- **Quality Assessment**: Excellent. This is a textbook implementation of the Strategy pattern, making the system easy to extend with new review types without modifying the core orchestration logic.

---
- **Pattern Name**: Adapter Pattern
- **TypeScript Implementation**: The project provides a unified interface for multiple AI providers (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter). Each provider has its own client implementation (`geminiClient.ts`, `anthropicClient.ts`, etc.) that adapts the provider-specific API to a common `AbstractClient` interface used by the rest of the application.
- **File Locations**:
  - `src/clients/base/abstractClient.ts` (The target interface)
  - `src/clients/implementations/geminiClient.ts` (Adapter)
  - `src/clients/implementations/anthropicClient.ts` (Adapter)
  - `src/clients/implementations/openaiClient.ts` (Adapter)
- **Type Safety Features**: The `AbstractClient` interface guarantees that any client, regardless of the underlying provider, will have the same methods and properties. This allows the `ReviewGenerator` to interact with any client in a consistent, type-safe manner.
- **Quality Assessment**: Excellent. This pattern is crucial for the tool's multi-provider support and is well-implemented, promoting modularity and making it easy to add new AI providers.

---
- **Pattern Name**: Singleton Pattern
- **TypeScript Implementation**: Based on project documentation (`PROJECT.md`), singletons are used for managing global resources or services. The implementation likely involves a private constructor and a static `getInstance()` method to ensure only one instance of a class is created.
- **File Locations**:
  - `src/database/PatternDatabase.ts` (Likely a singleton)
  - `src/utils/logger.ts` (Likely a singleton)
  - `src/prompts/cache/PromptCache.ts` (Likely a singleton)
- **Type Safety Features**: TypeScript's `private` constructor prevents instantiation from outside the class, and the static `getInstance` method's return type is the class itself, ensuring type safety for consumers.
- **Code Examples**:
  ```typescript
  // Inferred from documentation
  // In PatternDatabase.ts
  export class PatternDatabase {
    private static instance: PatternDatabase;
    private constructor() { /* ... */ }

    public static getInstance(): PatternDatabase {
      if (!PatternDatabase.instance) {
        PatternDatabase.instance = new PatternDatabase();
      }
      return PatternDatabase.instance;
    }
    // ... methods
  }
  ```
- **Quality Assessment**: Good. The use of singletons for stateful, shared resources like a database or cache is appropriate. The documented use of `getInstance()` suggests a standard and safe implementation.

---
- **Pattern Name**: Command Pattern
- **TypeScript Implementation**: The CLI functionality is structured around the Command pattern. User input from the command line (e.g., `review`, `list-models`, `test-build`) is parsed by `argumentParser.ts` and mapped to specific command handler modules within the `src/commands/` directory. Each command module encapsulates the logic for a specific action.
- **File Locations**:
  - `src/cli/argumentParser.ts` (The invoker)
  - `src/commands/reviewCode.ts` (Concrete command)
  - `src/commands/listModels.ts` (Concrete command)
  - `src/commands/testBuild.ts` (Concrete command)
  - `src/index.ts` (The client that wires up the parser and commands)
- **Type Safety Features**: The arguments for each command are strongly typed using interfaces or type aliases, ensuring that each command handler receives the expected data structure, which is validated at compile time.
- **Quality Assessment**: Excellent. This pattern provides a clean separation of concerns for CLI features, making the tool's command structure scalable and easy to maintain.

### 2. TypeScript Code Structure Metrics

Metrics are estimated based on the provided file list and documentation. Line counts are approximated using a heuristic of 50 bytes per line.

- **File Size Distribution** (233 `.ts` files analyzed):
  - **Small files (<50 lines / <2.5KB)**: 78 files (33.5%)
  - **Medium files (50-200 lines / 2.5KB-10KB)**: 96 files (41.2%)
  - **Large files (200+ lines / >10KB)**: 59 files (25.3%)
  - *Observation*: A healthy distribution with a large number of small, focused modules, but also a significant number of large files that might be candidates for refactoring (e.g., `SemanticChunkingIntegration.ts`, `reviewOrchestrator.ts`, `configManager.ts`).

- **Type Definition Metrics**:
  - **Total dedicated type/schema files**: 15 (`src/types/*.ts` and `src/prompts/schemas/*.ts`)
  - **Total interfaces**: Estimated 100-150. Inferred from the number of schema files and the complexity of the application.
  - **Total type aliases**: Estimated 50-100. Often used for union types and simpler data structures.
  - **Total enums**: Estimated 10-20. Likely used for `ReviewType`, `Priority`, etc.
  - **Total classes**: Estimated 80-100. Inferred from files named `*Manager`, `*Client`, `*Factory`, `*Strategy`, `*Handler`, etc.

- **Function Signature Analysis**:
  - *Not possible to determine from the provided information.* However, the use of typed option objects for complex functions is a common and recommended pattern that is likely in use here.

- **Generic Usage**:
  - **Frequency**: Moderate. Generics are likely used in key architectural components like factories, strategies, and API clients.
  - **Complexity**: Varies from simple (e.g., `Promise<T>`) to moderately complex (e.g., in factories `create<T extends BaseClass>(type): T` or in utility types). The documentation's mention of `Pick`, `Partial`, etc., confirms the use of generic utility types.

### 3. TypeScript Code Composition Analysis

- **Type Safety Metrics**:
  - **Explicitly typed**: Estimated 85-90%. The project's documentation emphasizes `strict: true` and avoiding `any`, indicating a strong commitment to type safety.
  - **Inferred**: Estimated 10-15%. TypeScript's type inference is likely leveraged for local variables where the type is obvious.
  - **Using 'any'**: Estimated <1%. The stated goal is to avoid `any`, so its usage is likely minimal and restricted to specific cases like third-party library integration or dynamic data.

- **Interface vs Type Usage**:
  - **Ratio**: Cannot be determined precisely.
  - **Usage Patterns**: Based on common TypeScript practices, `interface` is likely used for defining the shape of objects and for class contracts (e.g., `ReviewStrategy`). `type` aliases are likely used for creating union types, intersections, and aliasing primitives or complex utility types. The presence of many schema files in `src/prompts/schemas` suggests that Zod objects (which function as types) are heavily used for defining the structure of AI responses.

- **Original vs Library Code**:
  - **Custom TypeScript business logic**: Estimated 75%. The core logic for orchestration, file discovery, semantic chunking, review strategies, and prompt management is all custom.
  - **Third-party dependencies**: Estimated 25%. This includes AI provider SDKs, CLI argument parsers (yargs), templating engines (Handlebars), and schema validators (Zod).

- **Class vs Function Balance**:
  - **OOP patterns (Classes)**: Estimated 60%. The core architecture is built around classes (Strategies, Clients, Factories, Managers). This provides clear structure and state management.
  - **Functional patterns (Functions)**: Estimated 40%. The `utils` directory is extensive, suggesting a heavy reliance on pure, reusable functions for tasks like parsing, formatting, and validation. This indicates a healthy hybrid approach, using classes for architecture and functions for data transformation and utilities.

### 4. TypeScript Architectural Patterns

- **Type System Architecture**:
  - **Centralized Types**: Core application types are centralized in `src/types/`, promoting reusability and a single source of truth for data structures.
  - **Schema-Defined Types**: AI response structures are defined using Zod schemas in `src/prompts/schemas/`. This is an excellent pattern that combines runtime validation with static type generation, ensuring that data from external APIs conforms to the application's expectations.
  - **Domain-Specific Types**: Types are organized by domain (e.g., `review.ts`, `configuration.ts`), which makes the type system easier to navigate.

- **Module Organization**:
  - **Feature-Based Grouping**: The `src` directory is organized by feature/responsibility (e.g., `clients`, `strategies`, `analysis`, `prompts`). This is a scalable and maintainable approach.
  - **Clear Boundaries**: Each directory exposes its public API through an `index.ts` file, hiding internal implementation details.
  - **Separation of Concerns**: A clear distinction exists between core logic (`core`), external service clients (`clients`), utility functions (`utils`), and data definitions (`types`, `prompts/schemas`).

- **Dependency Injection**:
  - **Factory-Based DI**: The project uses the Factory pattern as a form of manual Dependency Injection. Instead of a DI container/framework, factories (`StrategyFactory`, `ClientFactory`) are responsible for creating and providing dependencies to the core application logic (e.g., `reviewOrchestrator`). This is a lightweight and effective approach for this type of application.

- **Configuration Management**:
  - **Unified & Layered Configuration**: The `unifiedConfig.ts` module and the `CONFIGURATION_MIGRATION.md` document describe a very robust configuration system. It layers configuration from multiple sources (CLI arguments, environment variables, config files) with a clear order of precedence.
  - **Typed and Validated**: Configuration is strongly typed and validated (likely with Zod), preventing runtime errors from invalid settings and providing clear error messages.

### 5. TypeScript Implementation Patterns

- **Generic Patterns**:
  - Generics are fundamental to the flexibility of the factories and strategies. They allow for creating reusable components that can operate on different types while maintaining full type safety. For example, a generic review handler could work with different schema-validated response types.

- **Utility Type Usage**:
  - The documentation explicitly mentions the use of built-in utility types like `Pick`, `Partial`, and `Required`. This is a best practice in TypeScript for creating new types from existing ones without duplication, leading to more maintainable and less error-prone code.

- **Type Guards**:
  - Given the `strict: true` setting and interaction with external APIs, type guards are almost certainly used extensively. They would be found in response processing logic (`responseProcessor.ts`) and schema validation to narrow down types from `unknown` or broad unions to specific, usable types. Custom type guard functions (e.g., `isArchitecturalReview(data): data is ArchitecturalReview`) are a key pattern for this.

- **Error Handling**:
  - The presence of `apiErrorHandler.ts` and `errorLogger.ts` indicates a centralized and structured approach to error handling. Instead of generic `try/catch` blocks everywhere, errors (especially from API calls) are likely wrapped in custom error classes and handled by a dedicated module. This pattern improves logging, user feedback, and application stability.
