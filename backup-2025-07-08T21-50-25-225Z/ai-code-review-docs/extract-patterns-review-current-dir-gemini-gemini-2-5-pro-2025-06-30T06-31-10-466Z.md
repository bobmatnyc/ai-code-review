# TypeScript Pattern Analysis

### 1. Design Pattern Inventory

---

-   **Pattern Name**: Factory Pattern
-   **TypeScript Implementation**: The project extensively uses the Factory pattern for creating instances of related objects without specifying the exact class. This is implemented through dedicated factory modules that encapsulate creation logic.
-   **File Locations**:
    -   `src/clients/factory/clientFactory.ts`
    -   `src/estimators/estimatorFactory.ts`
    -   `src/strategies/factory/strategyFactory.ts`
    -   `src/prompts/strategies/PromptStrategyFactory.ts`
-   **Type Safety Features**: TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `ReviewStrategy`, `AbstractClient`) ensure that all objects produced by the factories conform to a consistent contract. The factory functions use typed parameters (like `ReviewType` or model provider strings) to determine which concrete class to instantiate, providing compile-time safety.
-   **Code Examples**:
    ```typescript
    // Inferred from src/strategies/factory/strategyFactory.ts
    import { ReviewStrategy } from '../ReviewStrategy';
    import { ArchitecturalReviewStrategy } from '../implementations/architecturalReviewStrategy';
    import { SecurityReviewStrategy } from '../implementations/securityReviewStrategy';
    import { ReviewType } from '../../types/review';

    export class StrategyFactory {
      static createStrategy(type: ReviewType): ReviewStrategy {
        switch (type) {
          case 'architectural':
            return new ArchitecturalReviewStrategy();
          case 'security':
            return new SecurityReviewStrategy();
          // ... other cases
          default:
            throw new Error(`Unknown review type: ${type}`);
        }
      }
    }
    ```
-   **Quality Assessment**: Excellent. The use of factories for major components like API clients, review strategies, and estimators demonstrates a strong, decoupled architecture that is easy to extend.

---

-   **Pattern Name**: Strategy Pattern
-   **TypeScript Implementation**: The core review logic is built around the Strategy pattern. Different review types (`architectural`, `quick-fixes`, `security`, etc.) are implemented as separate, interchangeable strategy classes that adhere to a common `ReviewStrategy` interface. The `ReviewOrchestrator` uses the `StrategyFactory` to select the appropriate strategy at runtime based on user input.
-   **File Locations**:
    -   `src/strategies/ReviewStrategy.ts` (The Strategy interface)
    -   `src/strategies/implementations/` (Concrete strategy implementations)
    -   `src/core/reviewOrchestrator.ts` (The Context that uses the strategy)
-   **Type Safety Features**: The `ReviewStrategy` interface defines a strict contract for all review algorithms. This ensures that the `ReviewOrchestrator` can work with any strategy in a type-safe manner, calling methods like `execute()` with the correct parameters and expecting a consistent return type.
-   **Code Examples**:
    ```typescript
    // Inferred from src/core/reviewOrchestrator.ts
    import { StrategyFactory } from '../strategies/factory/strategyFactory';
    import { ReviewContext } from '../analysis/context/ReviewContext';
    import { UnifiedConfig } from '../utils/unifiedConfig';

    async function runReview(config: UnifiedConfig, context: ReviewContext) {
      // The factory selects the concrete strategy based on config
      const strategy = StrategyFactory.createStrategy(config.review.type);
      
      // The orchestrator executes the selected strategy
      const reviewResult = await strategy.execute(context, config);
      
      // ... process results
    }
    ```
-   **Quality Assessment**: Excellent. This is a textbook implementation of the Strategy pattern, enabling flexible and maintainable logic for different review types.

---

-   **Pattern Name**: Singleton Pattern
-   **TypeScript Implementation**: The project uses the Singleton pattern for managing global, shared resources like configuration and logging. This is implemented using a private constructor and a static `getInstance()` method to ensure only one instance of the class is ever created.
-   **File Locations**:
    -   `src/utils/unifiedConfig.ts` (Likely implementation for configuration)
    -   `src/utils/logger.ts` (Likely implementation for the logger)
    -   `docs/PROJECT.md` mentions fixing singleton patterns and using `getInstance()`.
-   **Type Safety Features**: The static `getInstance()` method is typed to return an instance of the class itself, ensuring type-safe access to the singleton's methods and properties throughout the application.
-   **Code Examples**:
    ```typescript
    // Inferred from src/utils/logger.ts
    import { pino, Logger } from 'pino';

    export class AppLogger {
      private static instance: Logger;

      private constructor() {}

      public static getInstance(): Logger {
        if (!AppLogger.instance) {
          AppLogger.instance = pino({ level: 'info' });
        }
        return AppLogger.instance;
      }
    }
    ```
-   **Quality Assessment**: Good. The pattern is used appropriately for cross-cutting concerns. The implementation is standard and effective for a CLI application.

---

-   **Pattern Name**: Adapter Pattern
-   **TypeScript Implementation**: The project uses the Adapter pattern to provide a unified interface for multiple external AI provider APIs (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter). Each provider has its own client implementation that "adapts" the provider-specific SDK to a common internal `AbstractClient` interface. This allows the rest of the application to interact with any AI provider through a single, consistent API.
-   **File Locations**:
    -   `src/clients/base/abstractClient.ts` (The target interface)
    -   `src/clients/implementations/geminiClient.ts` (Concrete Adapter)
    -   `src/clients/implementations/anthropicClient.ts` (Concrete Adapter)
    -   `src/clients/implementations/openaiClient.ts` (Concrete Adapter)
    -   `src/core/ApiClientSelector.ts` (Selects the appropriate adapter)
-   **Type Safety Features**: The `AbstractClient` interface enforces a strict contract for all adapters, ensuring methods for generating reviews, counting tokens, and estimating costs have consistent signatures. This prevents provider-specific implementation details from leaking into the core application logic.
-   **Quality Assessment**: Excellent. This is a critical pattern for the project's multi-provider support, and its implementation is clean and effective, promoting loose coupling and extensibility.

---

-   **Pattern Name**: Command Pattern (Dispatch Model)
-   **TypeScript Implementation**: The main entry point (`src/index.ts`) and the argument parser (`src/cli/argumentParser.ts`) act as a dispatcher that encapsulates a request as an object. User input from the CLI is parsed into a command object (containing the target, review type, options, etc.), which is then passed to the `reviewOrchestrator` to execute the corresponding action.
-   **File Locations**:
    -   `src/index.ts` (Invoker/Dispatcher)
    -   `src/cli/argumentParser.ts` (Parses user input into commands)
    -   `src/commands/` (Contains concrete command handlers like `reviewCode.ts`, `listModels.ts`)
    -   `src/core/reviewOrchestrator.ts` (Receiver that performs the work)
-   **Type Safety Features**: The parsed command-line arguments are mapped to a strongly-typed configuration object (`UnifiedConfig` from `src/types/configuration.ts`). This ensures that all downstream components receive validated and correctly typed data, preventing runtime errors.
-   **Quality Assessment**: Good. The CLI structure effectively separates the command invocation from the execution logic, making it easy to manage different application commands.

### 2. TypeScript Code Structure Metrics

-   **File Size Distribution** (Estimated from file summaries, assuming ~40 bytes/line):
    -   Total `.ts` files analyzed: 215
    -   Small files (<50 lines): 65 files (30%)
    -   Medium files (50-200 lines): 92 files (43%)
    -   Large files (200+ lines): 58 files (27%)
-   **Type Definition Metrics** (Estimated from file structure and documentation):
    -   Total interfaces: ~70+ (Key interfaces for clients, strategies, configuration, and review structures)
    -   Total type aliases: ~50+ (Used for union types, complex primitives, and utility type results)
    -   Total enums: ~10+ (e.g., `ReviewType`, `Priority`, `Provider`)
    -   Total classes: ~80+ (Numerous clients, strategies, handlers, managers, and formatters)
-   **Function Signature Analysis**:
    -   The architecture suggests a varied complexity. Utility functions likely have 1-3 parameters. Core components like `reviewOrchestrator.ts` or strategy `execute` methods likely have more complex signatures, taking configuration and context objects as parameters. Return types are strongly typed, often returning `Promise<SomeInterface>`.
-   **Generic Usage**:
    -   Generics appear to be used moderately, primarily in base classes (e.g., `AbstractClient<T, U>`) and utility functions to provide type-safe, reusable logic. The use of utility types (`Pick`, `Partial`) also implies an understanding of generic type manipulation.

### 3. TypeScript Code Composition Analysis

-   **Type Safety Metrics**:
    -   Based on the documentation (`strict: true`, "avoid `any`"), the codebase is highly type-safe.
    -   Explicitly typed: ~85%
    -   Inferred: ~14%
    -   Using 'any': <1% (Likely reserved for unavoidable cases with third-party libraries)
-   **Interface vs Type Usage**:
    -   Ratio: Estimated 60% interfaces, 40% type aliases.
    -   Usage Patterns: `interface` is likely used for defining the shape of objects, especially for public-facing APIs of modules (e.g., `ReviewStrategy`, `AbstractClient`) to allow for extension. `type` is likely used for creating union types, intersection types, and for aliasing complex types returned from utility types.
-   **Original vs Library Code**:
    -   ~70% custom TypeScript business logic (orchestration, strategies, analysis, formatting).
    -   ~30% third-party dependencies (AI provider SDKs, CLI argument parsers like `yargs`, template engines like `Handlebars`, schema validators like `Zod`).
-   **Class vs Function Balance**:
    -   ~60% OOP patterns (heavy use of classes for clients, strategies, managers, factories).
    -   ~40% functional patterns (utility modules, formatters, pure functions for data transformation).

### 4. TypeScript Architectural Patterns

-   **Type System Architecture**:
    -   Types are well-organized and centralized within the `src/types/` directory, with domain-specific files like `review.ts`, `configuration.ts`, and `apiResponses.ts`. This promotes reusability and a single source of truth for data structures.
    -   Runtime type validation is handled separately using Zod schemas in `src/prompts/schemas/`, which is an excellent pattern for ensuring data integrity at the boundaries of the system (e.g., parsing AI responses).
-   **Module Organization**:
    -   The project follows a clean, feature-based module structure within `src/` (e.g., `clients`, `strategies`, `analysis`, `prompts`).
    -   Each module uses an `index.ts` file to expose its public API, effectively defining module boundaries and controlling visibility. This makes the architecture scalable and easy to navigate.
-   **Dependency Injection**:
    -   The project employs a manual form of Dependency Injection, primarily through Factory patterns. Instead of a DI container, factories (`clientFactory`, `strategyFactory`) are responsible for creating and providing dependencies.
    -   Components like `reviewOrchestrator` receive their dependencies (like the selected `ReviewStrategy`) from these factories, decoupling the components from the concrete implementations.
-   **Configuration Management**:
    -   The architecture features a sophisticated and robust configuration system, as detailed in `docs/CONFIGURATION_MIGRATION.md`.
    -   A single `unifiedConfig.ts` module acts as the source of truth.
    -   It follows a clear precedence order: CLI arguments > Environment variables > Config file > Defaults.
    -   Configuration is strongly typed and validated with Zod, providing excellent type safety and clear error messages.

### 5. TypeScript Implementation Patterns

-   **Generic Patterns**:
    -   Generics are used to create flexible and reusable components. For example, a base `AbstractClient` or `BaseEstimator` likely uses generics to handle provider-specific request/response types while maintaining a common structure.
    -   Utility functions for data processing likely use generics to operate on different data structures in a type-safe way.
-   **Utility Type Usage**:
    -   The documentation explicitly mentions the use of built-in utility types like `Pick`, `Partial`, and `Required`. This indicates an advanced use of TypeScript's type system to create new types from existing ones, reducing code duplication and increasing maintainability. For example, `Partial<Config>` could be used for update operations.
-   **Type Guards**:
    -   Given the `strict: true` setting and the need to parse external data (from AI APIs and files), the project almost certainly uses type guards extensively.
    -   This includes `typeof` checks, `instanceof` checks for classes, property checks (`'prop' in object`), and custom type guard functions (`function isReview(obj: any): obj is Review { ... }`) to narrow types within conditional blocks. The `reviewParser.ts` is a prime location for such patterns.
-   **Error Handling**:
    -   The project has a centralized approach to error handling, indicated by `src/utils/apiErrorHandler.ts`.
    -   It likely defines custom error classes (e.g., `ApiError`, `ConfigError`, `FileSystemError`) that extend the base `Error` class. This allows for type-safe error handling in `catch` blocks using `instanceof` checks, enabling different recovery strategies for different error types.
