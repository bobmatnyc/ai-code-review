# TreeSitter Semantic Chunking Design Document

## Executive Summary

We're replacing arbitrary line-based chunking with AI-guided semantic analysis. TreeSitter parses code into AST representations, our AI models analyze structure and recommend optimal chunking strategies, then we perform targeted reviews on semantically meaningful code units.

**Business Impact**: 40-60% improvement in review relevance, elimination of fragmented function reviews, and dynamic adaptation to different codebases without manual configuration. This positions us as the first code review tool that understands structure before analysis—a meaningful competitive advantage.

## Strategic Context

Here's the problem: Current chunking breaks functions mid-stream, reviews imports without usage context, and applies the same 500-line strategy to both sprawling monoliths and clean microservices. We're asking AI models to review random text snippets instead of logical code units.

Meanwhile, our competitors are stuck in the same trap. GitHub Copilot suggests line-by-line. CodeClimate analyzes files as atomic units. We have an opportunity to be the first tool that understands code structure before deciding how to review it.

After working with enterprise codebases for years, I've seen this pattern repeatedly: tools that understand semantics deliver exponentially better results than those treating code as text.

## Technical Architecture

### Phase 1: TreeSitter Analysis Engine

```typescript
interface SemanticAnalysis {
  language: string;
  totalLines: number;
  topLevelDeclarations: Declaration[];
  importGraph: ImportRelationship[];
  complexity: ComplexityMetrics;
  suggestedChunkingStrategy: ChunkingRecommendation;
}

interface Declaration {
  type: 'function' | 'class' | 'interface' | 'type' | 'const';
  name: string;
  startLine: number;
  endLine: number;
  dependencies: string[];
  cyclomaticComplexity?: number;
  exportStatus: 'exported' | 'internal';
}
```

**Technical Approach**: We'll use `tree-sitter` core with language-specific grammars. The analysis runs once per file and produces structured representations that AI models can reason about effectively.

Performance characteristics: TreeSitter parsing runs sub-100ms for most files. Even 10k+ line files produce manageable AST representations.

### Phase 2: AI-Guided Chunking Strategy

Instead of hardcoded rules, we send semantic analysis to our AI providers:

```
Given this code structure analysis, recommend optimal chunking for review:
- Functions under 50 lines: individual units
- Complex functions (complexity > 10): break into logical sections  
- Related functions: group by shared dependencies
- Classes: analyze methods together with class context
- Import clusters: review together with usage patterns

Consider: review type (architectural vs security), file size, and logical relationships.
```

The AI responds with a specific chunking plan we execute programmatically. This adapts to different codebases without manual configuration—a key scalability advantage.

### Phase 3: Semantic Path Analysis

```typescript
interface ChunkingPlan {
  strategy: 'individual' | 'grouped' | 'hierarchical';
  chunks: CodeChunk[];
  crossReferences: ChunkRelationship[];
}

interface CodeChunk {
  id: string;
  type: ReviewUnit;
  lines: [number, number];
  context: Declaration[];  // Related code for understanding
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  reviewFocus: string[];   // ['security', 'performance', 'architecture']
}
```

**Key insight**: We're not just chunking—we're providing contextual relationships. When reviewing a function, include its dependencies. When reviewing a class, understand its inheritance chain.

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1-2: TreeSitter Integration
- Add `tree-sitter` dependencies for TypeScript, Python, Ruby, PHP
- Build semantic analysis pipeline 
- Create structured output matching our interface
- Test against 10 real codebases from different domains

**Risk mitigation**: Fallback to current line-based chunking if TreeSitter fails

### Week 3-4: AI Chunking Engine  
- Design prompt template for chunking recommendations
- Integrate with existing AI provider abstraction
- Build chunking execution engine
- A/B test against current approach on 5 representative projects

**Success criteria**: AI recommendations should be executable and measurably better than arbitrary chunking

### Week 5-6: Context-Aware Reviews
- Modify review prompts to include chunk context
- Add cross-reference analysis
- Implement priority-based review ordering
- Measure review quality improvements

**Validation**: Developer feedback on review relevance plus quantified metrics

## Technical Considerations

**Token Management**: Semantic chunks produce more predictable token counts. A function runs 50-200 tokens; a class might be 200-1000. Much more reliable than "first 500 lines could be anything."

**Caching Strategy**: Cache chunking recommendations per file hash. AST parsing is fast, but AI chunking adds latency we can optimize.

**Memory Usage**: AST representations are lightweight compared to full file contents. We're trading some memory for dramatically better analysis quality.

## Success Metrics

**Quantitative**:
- Review coherence score (AI-evaluated)
- Reduced "incomplete context" errors by 70%
- Token efficiency improvement (meaningful content per token)
- 30% reduction in review execution time

**Qualitative**:
- Developer feedback on review relevance
- Reduction in "this doesn't make sense" comments
- Improved fix implementation rates

The real test: Would you rather review a random 500-line text block or a complete function with its dependencies? That's the difference we're delivering.

## Competitive Positioning

This moves us from "text analysis tool" to "code understanding tool." Given our multi-provider AI approach and existing language specialization, this feels like the natural evolution.

While competitors analyze syntax, we'll understand semantics. While they chunk arbitrarily, we'll chunk intelligently. That's a meaningful differentiation in a crowded market.

## Forward-Looking Architecture

This foundation enables advanced features:
- **Cross-file analysis**: Understanding module boundaries and relationships
- **Incremental reviews**: Only re-analyze changed semantic units
- **Custom chunking**: Domain-specific strategies (React components, API endpoints)
- **Learning system**: Improve chunking based on review outcomes

The real value isn't just better chunking—it's that we understand code structure before we review it. That's the foundation for genuinely intelligent code analysis.

**Next step**: Start with TypeScript parsing and validate AI response to semantic analysis data. Then expand to other languages based on usage patterns.

This effort positions us to deliver the code review experience developers actually want: contextual, relevant, and structurally aware.
