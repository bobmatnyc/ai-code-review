# Claude Code Documentation Improvement Epic

## CRITICAL: Epic and Task Management Requirements

**BEFORE STARTING**: This work MUST be structured as a proper epic with subtickets:

### Epic Structure Setup

1. **Create Epic Ticket**: "Documentation Optimization and Claude Code Integration"
2. **Create Subtickets** for each major component (see breakdown below)
3. **Create Epic Branch**: Base branch for all documentation work
4. **Create Subticket Branches**: Individual branches for each subticket off the epic branch
5. **Follow Proper Workflow**: Each subticket gets its own branch, commits, and PR back to epic branch
6. **Epic Completion**: Final PR from epic branch to main after all subtickets complete

- **Epic Branch Integration**: Regular merges from subticket branches to epic branch
- **Final Epic Review**: Comprehensive review before epic-to-main merge

## Objective

**Optimize, prune, and enhance** project documentation for maximum efficiency and clarity. Eliminate redundancy, improve accessibility, and ensure all important daily-use documentation is easily discoverable through main documentation files.

## Primary Tasks

### 1. Comprehensive Documentation Review & Source Analysis

- **MANDATORY**: Review ALL files in the `docs/` folder and subdirectories
- **Catalog**: Create complete inventory of existing documentation
- **Assess**: Current organization, redundancies, gaps, and inefficiencies
- **Read and analyze**: `docs/design/claude-code-best-practices.md`
- **Extract actionable insights** from the best practices document
- **Identify patterns** that should be incorporated into project workflows
- **Map**: How existing docs relate to each other and identify consolidation opportunities

### 2. Core Documentation Updates

Update these key files with best practices integration:

#### A. `CLAUDE.md` (Project Context)

- **Add**: Project-specific conventions and tool configurations
- **Include**: Development environment setup and testing procedures
- **Integrate**: TrackDown CLI workflows and MCP server configurations
- **Document**: Post-task verification procedures for TypeScript/Python

#### B. `docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md` (Technical Implementation)

- **Add**: Custom slash commands setup and MCP server configuration
- **Include**: Tool integration guidelines and permission management
- **Document**: Subagent usage patterns and CI/CD integration
- **Add**: Visual development workflow setup

#### C. `docs/WORKFLOW.md` (Process & Methodology)

- **Implement**: Planning-first approach documentation
- **Add**: Structured development patterns (TDD, visual dev, iterative refinement)
- **Include**: Session management and error monitoring patterns
- **Document**: Subagent parallelization strategies
- **ADD CRITICAL**: **YOLO Mode Requirements** - When in YOLO mode, ALWAYS work from a TrackDown task in a properly named branch tied to that task
- **ENFORCE**: All development work, including documentation epics like this one, must follow proper epic/subticket workflow with appropriate branching strategy
- **ADD CRITICAL**: **Task Linkage Requirements** - ALL to-dos and action items must be linked back to TrackDown ticket tasks
- **ADD CRITICAL**: **Code as Source of Truth** - Documentation must always reflect current source code state; assume code is correct when conflicts arise
- **Document**: Process for validating documentation against current codebase state

#### D. `docs/PROJECT.md` (Current State)

- **Update**: Reflect current project state and architecture
- **Document**: Active integrations and tool stack
- **Include**: Recent changes and development status

### 3. Complete Documentation Organization & Optimization

#### Comprehensive Docs Folder Review (REQUIRED)

- **MANDATORY**: Examine EVERY file in `docs/` and all subdirectories
- **Document**: Complete file inventory with purpose and content summary
- **PRUNE**: Identify redundant, outdated, obsolete, or low-value documentation for removal
- **OPTIMIZE**: Assess current categorization and logical grouping for efficiency improvements
- **CONSOLIDATE**: Flag files that should be merged to reduce fragmentation
- **CLARIFY**: Identify unclear or confusing documentation that needs rewriting

#### Root-Level Docs Consolidation & Optimization

- **ELIMINATE**: Remove ALL redundant and overlapping content
- **CONSOLIDATE**: Merge related content into single, comprehensive documents
- **PRUNE**: Remove outdated, incorrect, or low-value information
- **ENHANCE**: Improve clarity and readability of retained content
- **VALIDATE AGAINST CODE**: Ensure all technical documentation reflects current source code implementation
- **STREAMLINE**: Create optimal file structure with minimal navigation overhead
- **LINK ARCHITECTURE**: Ensure all important daily-use information is linked from main docs
- **TASK INTEGRATION**: Link all documented processes back to TrackDown ticket workflows
- **Archive Strategy**: Move non-essential historical content to `docs/archive/`
- **Chapter Strategy**: Use `docs/chapters/` only for truly detailed sections that would overwhelm main docs

#### Critical Linking & Truth Requirements

- **ALL daily-use information** must be accessible within 2 clicks from main documentation files
- **ALL to-dos and processes** must be linkable to TrackDown ticket tasks
- **Main docs** (`CLAUDE.md`, `TOOLCHAIN.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, `PROJECT.md`) should serve as primary navigation hubs
- **Quick reference sections** in main docs for frequently accessed information
- **Remove orphaned documentation** that isn't linked from anywhere
- **Code truth validation** for all technical documentation and setup instructions

#### Critical Documentation Principles

- **CODE AS SOURCE OF TRUTH**: Always assume source code is correct when documentation conflicts arise
- **TASK LINKAGE**: Every to-do, action item, and work unit must be linked to TrackDown ticket tasks
- **CURRENT STATE VALIDATION**: Documentation must reflect the actual current state of the codebase
- **CONTINUOUS ALIGNMENT**: Regular verification that docs match code reality
- **TRUTH VERIFICATION PROCESS**: Systematic approach to validating documentation against source code

#### Size & Efficiency Optimization

- **Target**: Maximum efficiency for daily developer workflow
- **Eliminate**: Verbose explanations that can be simplified
- **Prioritize**: Actionable information over theoretical discussions
- **Structure**: Scannable headings, bullet points, and clear sections
- **Context-aware**: Optimize for Claude's context window consumption patterns

### 4. Epic Execution Strategy

Choose the appropriate execution approach:

#### Option A: Sequential Execution

Execute subtickets in dependency order:

1. **Subticket 1** (Audit) → 2. **Subticket 2** (CLAUDE.md/INSTRUCTIONS.md) → 3. **Subticket 3** (WORKFLOW.md) → 4. **Subticket 4** (PROJECT.md) → 5. **Subticket 5** (Structure) → 6. **Subticket 6** (Validation)

#### Option B: Parallel Execution with Coordination

If you can safely work in parallel subprocesses:

- **Subagent 1**: Handle Subticket 1 (Audit) first, then Subticket 5 (Structure optimization)
- **Subagent 2**: Handle Subticket 2 (CLAUDE.md context + TOOLCHAIN.md toolchain focus)
- **Subagent 3**: Handle Subticket 3 (WORKFLOW.md build/deploy processes) and Subticket 4 (PROJECT.md business context)
- **Subagent 4**: Handle Subticket 6 (Validation) after others complete their work

**Epic Coordination Requirements**:

- All subagents must coordinate on structural decisions
- **Maintain clear file purpose separation**: toolchain vs workflow vs business context
- Epic branch must be kept up-to-date with completed subtickets
- Dependencies must be respected (audit before major reorganization)

## Key Requirements

### YOLO Mode Integration (Critical Addition)

- **Document clearly**: YOLO mode MUST use TrackDown tasks
- **Specify**: Branch naming conventions tied to TrackDown tasks
- **Include**: Workflow for task creation → branch creation → development → completion
- **Add to**: `docs/WORKFLOW.md` as a dedicated section

### Quality Standards

- **RUTHLESS OPTIMIZATION**: Eliminate ALL unnecessary content and redundancy
- **CLARITY FIRST**: Every sentence must add clear value to daily development workflow
- **ACCESSIBILITY**: All important information reachable within 2 clicks from main docs
- **TASK LINKAGE**: All processes and to-dos must be traceable to TrackDown tickets
- **CODE-TRUTH ALIGNMENT**: Documentation must accurately reflect current source code state
- **CONSISTENCY**: Unified formatting, terminology, and structure across all documentation
- **ACTIONABILITY**: Focus on what developers need to DO, not just what they need to know
- **VERIFY**: Cross-references and links work correctly and lead to valuable content
- **VALIDATE**: No conflicting or contradictory information across documents
- **SOURCE VERIFICATION**: All technical instructions validated against actual codebase implementation

### Deliverables
