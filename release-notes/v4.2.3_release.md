### üöÄ Key Improvements

#### 1. **Critical Assessment Focus**
- Reframed evaluation from balanced assessment to frank, critical analysis
- Changed evaluator role to "senior hiring manager with 15+ years experience"
- Added emphasis on identifying red flags and production risks
- Focus on determining if developers can be trusted with critical systems

#### 2. **Enhanced Evaluation Criteria**

- **Letter Grade System**: Added A-F grades for multiple dimensions:
  - Architectural Sophistication
  - Security Practices
  - Test Coverage & Quality
  - Documentation Quality
  - Best Practices Adherence
  - Code Maintainability
  - Performance Awareness
  - Error Handling

#### 3. **Improved AI Detection**
- Added specific AI code generation tells and patterns
- Enhanced detection criteria including:
  - Documentation mismatches
  - Import bloat
  - Error handling theater
  - Configuration confusion
  - Async abuse patterns
  - Dead code indicators
- Percentage-based likelihood assessment (0-100%)
- Required evidence documentation

#### 4. **Structured Output Format**
- Technical competency scoring (1-10 scale)
- Clear hiring recommendations: Strong Hire/Hire/Conditional Hire/No Hire
- Specific conditions and restrictions for conditional hires
- Required security posture assessment
- Team fit risk evaluation
- Frank executive summaries

### üìã Detailed Changes

#### Prompt Enhancements
- Updated generic evaluation template with critical assessment framework
- Added explicit output format requirements
- Enhanced skill gap identification criteria

#### AI Detection Improvements
- Added "Specific AI Tells to Look For" section
- Enhanced human development pattern recognition
- Added evidence of real-world constraints detection
- Improved copy-paste pattern identification

### üîß Technical Details
- Modified `promptText/languages/generic/evaluation.hbs`
- Updated `src/prompts/bundledPrompts.ts` with enhanced evaluation prompt
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing review types

### üí° Usage Example
```bash
ai-code-review . --type evaluation
```

The evaluation will now provide:
- Developer level assessment (Novice through Principal)
- Letter grades for code quality dimensions
- Critical skill gap identification
- AI assistance likelihood percentage
- Direct hiring recommendations
- Production system readiness assessment

### üéØ Benefits
- More actionable hiring decisions
- Better identification of security risks
- Clearer assessment of production readiness
- Improved detection of AI-generated code
- Direct, honest evaluations for critical systems
