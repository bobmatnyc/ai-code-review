# v4.2.2 Release Notes

## Overview
Version 4.2.2 includes critical fixes for the evaluation prompt system and significant performance improvements for semantic chunking.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Evaluation Prompt Fix
The evaluation review type now correctly performs pure developer assessment without suggesting improvements. We've strengthened the prompt instructions with:
- **CRITICAL** warnings at the beginning
- **FORBIDDEN** directives to explicitly prevent improvement suggestions
- **FINAL REMINDER** at the end to reinforce assessment-only behavior

This ensures the evaluation review focuses solely on:
- Developer skill level assessment (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Expert)
- AI assistance likelihood detection
- Professional maturity evaluation
- Meta coding quality indicators

### 2. Semantic Chunking Optimization
Dramatically reduced API calls through intelligent batch consolidation:
- **Single batch priority**: Attempts to fit all semantic threads in one batch when possible
- **Smart merging**: Combines smaller semantic groups to minimize batch count
- **Increased limits**: Thread limit per batch increased from 15 to 30
- **Result**: Up to 67% reduction in API calls (e.g., 21 threads now = 1 batch instead of 3)

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/prompts/bundledPrompts.ts` - Strengthened evaluation prompt
- `promptText/languages/generic/evaluation.hbs` - Updated template with stronger directives
- `src/analysis/semantic/SemanticChunkingIntegration.ts` - Optimized batch consolidation logic

### Testing
The evaluation prompt was tested on the codebase and confirmed to produce pure assessment without improvement suggestions.

## Upgrade Notes
