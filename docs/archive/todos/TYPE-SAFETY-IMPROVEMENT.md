# Type Safety Improvements: Unused Locals and Parameters

## Background

We have enabled TypeScript's strict checking for unused locals and parameters in the codebase to improve code quality. This has revealed several areas where variables are declared but not used.

## Current Status

The build scripts have been modified to temporarily bypass these errors during regular builds, but a strict check is still available:

- Regular build: `npm run build:types` (bypasses unused local/parameter errors)
- Strict build: `npm run build:types:strict` (enforces all strict checks)

## TODO Items

The following files need to be fixed to comply with the strict TypeScript settings:

### High Priority

- src/estimators/estimatorFactory.ts
- src/prompts/meta/PromptOptimizer.ts
- src/strategies/CodeTracingUnusedCodeReviewStrategy.ts
- src/utils/dependencies/unusedDependencies.ts (already fixed)

### Medium Priority

- src/strategies/implementations/* (Remove unused imports like logger and ClientFactory)
- src/prompts/PromptManager.ts
- src/prompts/utils/LangChainUtils.ts

### Lower Priority

- src/test-latest.ts, src/test-model.ts, src/tests/apiConnectionTest.ts
- Remaining strategy files

## How to Fix

For each unused variable, either:

1. Use the variable in a meaningful way
2. Remove the variable if it's not needed
3. Prefix with underscore (e.g., `_variableName`) if the parameter is required by an interface but not used

## Future Work

Once all files are fixed, we can remove the special build settings and enforce strict TypeScript checks in all builds.
