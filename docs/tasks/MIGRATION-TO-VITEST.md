# Migration from Jest to Vitest

## Overview
This document outlines a planned migration from Jest to Vitest for the test suite in the ai-code-review project.

## Motivation
- **Performance**: Vitest offers better performance and faster test execution compared to Jest
- **Modern JavaScript Support**: Better support for ES modules and TypeScript
- **Vite Integration**: More seamless integration with Vite-based projects
- **Security**: Addresses potential security vulnerabilities in older test frameworks
- **Developer Experience**: Improved developer experience with faster feedback loops

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation
- [ ] Audit current test coverage and identify key test patterns
- [ ] Document Jest-specific features currently in use
- [ ] Create a vitest configuration file
- [ ] Update package.json with vitest scripts

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Install required dependencies (`vitest`, any needed plugins)
- [ ] Migrate test configurations
- [ ] Update test mocks and spies to use Vitest syntax
- [ ] Address any Jest-specific features that need alternatives in Vitest
- [ ] Run tests in parallel with both frameworks to ensure compatibility

### Phase 3: Completion
- [ ] Remove Jest dependencies
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines

## Estimated Timeline
- Estimated effort: Medium
- Target completion: Future release planning

## Additional Resources
- [Vitest Documentation](https://vitest.dev/)
- [Jest to Vitest Migration Guide](https://vitest.dev/guide/migration.html)

## Notes
- Vitest is mostly compatible with Jest's API, so the migration is expected to be relatively straightforward
- Test files themselves should require minimal changes
- The main changes will be in configuration and potentially in mocking implementations
