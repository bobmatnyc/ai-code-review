## Response to Issue #12: Address security vulnerabilities reported by Dependabot

We have investigated the security vulnerabilities reported by Dependabot. After careful consideration, we're taking the following approach:

1. **Create a Future Migration Plan**: We've documented a plan to migrate from Jest to Vitest in `docs/tasks/MIGRATION-TO-VITEST.md`. This migration will be handled in a future release rather than as an immediate change to ensure stability.

2. **Risk Assessment**: The current vulnerabilities are moderate and don't present an immediate security risk to production deployments.

3. **Recommended Action**: For now, we're closing this issue and will address the migration as part of our upcoming roadmap. We'll track progress on this task separately in our project management system.

Next steps:
- Add the Vitest migration to the project roadmap
- Schedule the work for an upcoming release cycle
- Implement the migration according to the documented plan

This approach allows us to address the security concerns methodically while maintaining stability in the current codebase.

*Note: The migration plan has been added to our documentation at `docs/tasks/MIGRATION-TO-VITEST.md`*
