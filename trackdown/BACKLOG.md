**Epic:** EP-002 Configuration & Usability
**Priority:** Medium
**Assignee:** @bobmatnyc
**Status:** Backlog
**Reporter:** @diveddie

**Bug Description:**
Architectural review fails due to npm installation errors when using Node v22 and React 19+. The tool attempts to install dependency-cruiser but encounters peer dependency conflicts.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Have a project that requires Node v22+ and React v19+
2. Install ai-code-review per the docs
3. Run npx ai-code-review src --type architectural

**Expected Behavior:**
The analysis completes without errors.

**Actual Behavior:**
NPM installation errors occur during dependency analysis, causing the architectural review to fail with ERESOLVE errors.

**Environment:**
- OS: Mac OSX Sequoia 15.4.1
- Node.js version: 22
- npm version: 10.2.3
- Shell: zsh

**Technical Notes:**
