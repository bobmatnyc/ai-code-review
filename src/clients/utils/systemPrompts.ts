- Suggested fix
- Impact of the issue

### Medium Priority
(Same format as high priority)

### Low Priority

1. Security vulnerabilities and CVEs
2. Version updates and recommendations 
3. Compatibility issues and breaking changes
4. Deprecation warnings
5. Maintenance status

Always include a dedicated "Dependency Security Analysis" section in your review that summarizes the findings from your dependency security checks. This is a critical part of the architectural review.`;
