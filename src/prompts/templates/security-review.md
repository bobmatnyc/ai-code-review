### ✅ Security Evaluation Checklist

#### 🔑 Authentication & Authorization
- Are there any hardcoded credentials or secrets?
- Is authentication implemented securely?
- Are authorization checks properly implemented?
- Are there any privilege escalation vulnerabilities?

- Are there any potential injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, command, etc.)?
- Is there proper encoding for output to prevent XSS?
- Are file uploads handled securely?

#### 🔐 Data Protection

- Are there any potential data leakage issues?
- Is PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handled according to best practices?
- Are there any insecure storage mechanisms?

#### 🚨 Error Handling & Logging
- Does error handling reveal sensitive information?
- Is logging implemented securely without exposing sensitive data?
- Are exceptions handled properly?
- Are there any potential information disclosure vulnerabilities?

#### 🌐 API Security
- Are API endpoints properly secured?
- Is rate limiting implemented where necessary?

### 📤 Output Format
Provide clear, structured feedback grouped by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low). For each issue:

1. **Vulnerability**: Brief description of the security issue
2. **Location**: File and line number(s)
3. **Risk**: Potential impact if exploited
4. **Recommended Fix**: Code snippet or description of how to address the issue
5. **Reference**: Link to relevant security standard or best practice (OWASP, CWE, etc.)

Focus on providing actionable security recommendations. Be thorough but practical - prioritize fixes based on risk level.

NOTE: Your suggestions are for manual implementation by the developer. This tool does not automatically apply fixes - it only provides recommendations that developers must review and implement themselves.
