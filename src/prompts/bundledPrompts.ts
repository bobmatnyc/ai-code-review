DELIVER: Brutally honest assessment focused on hiring decision. This determines if they get the job.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT: You MUST use the EXACT section headers and format provided below. Fill in the bracketed placeholders with your assessment. Do not add extra sections or change the structure.

YOUR RESPONSE MUST START WITH THE FOLLOWING EXACT TEXT:

## Developer Competency Evaluation

### Overall Assessment
**Technical Competency:** [SCORE] - [JUSTIFICATION]
**Years of Experience:** [RANGE]
**Developer Level:** [LEVEL]
**Production Readiness:** [STATUS]

> **Context**: This is an evaluation review focusing on understanding the developer behind the code, not improving the code itself.

## Critical Assessment Framework

### 1. Technical Competency Analysis

**Critical Skill Gaps (Red Flags):**
- Dangerous code patterns that expose security vulnerabilities
- Failure to validate inputs or sanitize outputs
- Missing critical error handling for production scenarios
- Performance anti-patterns that would fail at scale
- Hardcoded values where configuration is essential
- Synchronous operations where async is required
- Memory leaks or resource management failures
- Lack of defensive programming practices

**Production Readiness Indicators:**
- Understanding of security implications (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Proper secrets management and configuration
- Scalability considerations in architecture
- Error recovery and graceful degradation
- Logging and observability implementation
- Resource cleanup and connection management
- Concurrency and race condition awareness

**Experience Level Markers:**
- **0-2 years (Novice/Junior)**: Tutorial-following patterns, basic CRUD operations, minimal error handling
- **2-5 years (Junior/Mid-Level)**: Framework proficiency, some patterns, basic security awareness
- **5-8 years (Senior)**: Architecture decisions, performance optimization, security-first thinking
- **8-12 years (Staff)**: Platform thinking, operational excellence, mentorship patterns
- **12+ years (Principal)**: System design mastery, cross-team impact, strategic technical decisions

### 2. AI-Generated Code Detection

**Clear AI Generation Indicators (>80% likelihood):**
- Accepting dangerous boilerplate without security modifications
- Generic error messages lacking context ("An error occurred")
- Over-engineered abstractions for simple problems
- Missing domain-specific optimizations any experienced dev would include
- Inconsistent expertise levels within same codebase
- Tutorial-perfect syntax with fundamental logic flaws
- Comments explaining obvious code while missing critical context
- Framework misuse that suggests pattern matching without understanding
- Unnecessary complexity - using design patterns where simple functions suffice
- Perfect formatting but poor logical flow
- Generic variable names (data, result, item) throughout
- Copy-paste patterns with slight variations that don't make sense

**Specific AI Tells to Look For:**
- **Documentation Mismatch**: Overly detailed comments for trivial code, no comments for complex logic
- **Import Bloat**: Importing entire libraries for single functions
- **Error Handling Theater**: Try-catch blocks that catch and immediately re-throw
- **Configuration Confusion**: Mixing environment configs, hardcoded values, and ENV vars randomly
- **Testing Patterns**: Tests that test the framework, not the business logic
- **Async Abuse**: Using async/await where synchronous would be simpler and correct
- **Type Over-Engineering**: Complex generic types for simple use cases
- **Dead Code**: Unused functions/variables that seem like "just in case" additions

**Human Development Patterns:**
- Incremental complexity matching problem evolution
- Personal coding quirks and consistent style
- Context-aware shortcuts and pragmatic choices
- Evidence of debugging and problem-solving (console.logs, commented attempts)
- Natural evolution of architecture (can see the journey)
- Domain-specific knowledge application
- Opinionated technology choices with clear rationale
- Appropriate laziness - not reinventing wheels unnecessarily
- Evidence of real-world constraints (deadlines, technical debt comments)

### 3. Critical Decision Analysis

**Critical Decision Points:**
- **Security Decisions**: Are they making choices that expose systems to attacks?
- **Data Handling**: Do they understand data sensitivity and compliance requirements?
- **Architecture Choices**: Will their design decisions cause problems at scale?
- **Dependency Management**: Are they introducing supply chain risks?
- **Error Handling**: Will their app fail catastrophically or gracefully?
- **Performance Decisions**: Have they created bottlenecks that will emerge under load?
- **Operational Readiness**: Can this code be debugged and maintained in production?

**Judgment Quality Indicators:**
- Awareness of trade-offs and explicit decision documentation
- Understanding of failure modes and mitigation strategies
- Recognition of security implications in design choices
- Appropriate complexity for the problem domain
- Evidence of thinking beyond happy path scenarios

### 4. Production System Readiness

**Ready for Production Systems:**
- Defensive programming against malicious inputs
- Proper error boundaries and circuit breakers
- Resource limits and timeout implementations
- Security headers and CORS configuration
- Audit logging and compliance considerations
- Database transaction management
- Proper async/await and promise handling
- Memory management and garbage collection awareness

**NOT Ready for Production (Requires Supervision):**
- Happy-path-only implementations
- Unhandled promise rejections
- SQL queries vulnerable to injection
- Exposed sensitive data in logs or responses
- Missing authentication/authorization checks
- Synchronous blocking operations
- Unbounded loops or recursive calls
- Resource leaks (connections, file handles, memory)

### 5. Risk Assessment for Team Integration

**High-Risk Indicators:**
- Cowboy coding without considering team impact
- Ignoring established patterns and conventions
- Making breaking changes without migration paths
- Poor git hygiene (force pushes, massive commits)
- Lack of communication in code reviews
- Introducing dependencies without team consensus
- Disregarding security or compliance requirements

**Low-Risk/High-Value Indicators:**
- Following team conventions even when disagreeing
- Clear communication of technical decisions
- Incremental, reviewable changes
- Proactive identification of risks
- Knowledge sharing and documentation
- Respectful disagreement and compromise
- Focus on team velocity over individual preferences
