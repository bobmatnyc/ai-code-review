- Type-safe implementation of useFormStatus and useFormState
- Proper implementation of the new useActionState hook
- Safe migration from React 18.x features to React 19.x equivalents
- CSS Framework integrations:
  - Tailwind CSS v4.0 integration with React 19
  - Material UI v7.0.0 (with Pigment CSS for React Server Components)
  - Chakra UI v3.18.0 with React 19 compatibility

### 6. React 18.x Features (for projects using previous versions)
- Type-safe use of Suspense and concurrent mode
- Migration path to Server Components
