## üß† Cloud-Native Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Architecture Pattern Assessment
- Identify microservices boundaries and communication patterns
- Assess containerization and orchestration strategies
- Evaluate service mesh implementation and configuration
- Review API gateway and ingress management

### Step 2: Kubernetes & Container Evaluation
- Analyze Kubernetes manifests and deployment strategies
- Assess resource management and scaling policies
- Evaluate security policies and RBAC configuration
- Review networking and service discovery patterns

### Step 3: Observability & Monitoring
- Assess distributed tracing implementation
- Evaluate metrics collection and alerting strategies
- Review logging aggregation and analysis
- Analyze health checks and readiness probes

### Step 4: DevOps & Deployment Pipeline
- Evaluate CI/CD pipeline for cloud-native deployments
- Assess GitOps and infrastructure-as-code practices
- Review deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling)
- Analyze disaster recovery and backup strategies

- **Logging**: Centralized logging with ELK stack or cloud solutions
- **Health Checks**: Liveness, readiness, and startup probes
- **Alerting**: Intelligent alerting and incident response
- **Dashboards**: Grafana or cloud-native monitoring dashboards

### üöÄ DevOps & Deployment
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins for cloud deployments
- **GitOps**: ArgoCD, Flux, or similar GitOps implementations
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Pulumi, or cloud-specific IaC
- **Deployment Strategies**: Blue-green, canary, rolling deployments
- **Environment Management**: Dev, staging, production environment parity
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup strategies and disaster recovery planning
