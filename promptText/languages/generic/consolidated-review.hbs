## 🧠 Consolidated Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Codebase Understanding
- Analyze the overall project structure and architecture
- Identify the primary technologies, frameworks, and patterns used
- Assess the scope and complexity of the codebase
- Understand the business domain and requirements

### Step 2: Multi-Dimensional Quality Assessment
- Evaluate code quality across all files systematically
- Assess consistency of patterns and practices
- Identify cross-cutting concerns and architectural issues
- Analyze dependencies and integration points

### Step 3: Risk and Impact Analysis
- Prioritize findings by business impact and technical risk
- Assess maintainability and scalability implications
- Identify critical issues requiring immediate attention
- Evaluate long-term technical debt accumulation

### Step 4: Consolidated Recommendations
- Provide actionable recommendations organized by priority
- Suggest implementation strategies and timelines
- Consider resource constraints and team capabilities
- Balance theoretical best practices with practical considerations

## 🎯 Comprehensive Grading System

Provide a comprehensive grade for the codebase using the standard academic scale (A+ to F):

### Overall Grade Categories

1. **Functionality (25%)**: How well the code achieves its intended purpose
2. **Code Quality (20%)**: Adherence to best practices and clean code principles
3. **Architecture (15%)**: System design and component organization
4. **Documentation (10%)**: Quality of comments, README files, and documentation
5. **Testing (10%)**: Test coverage, quality, and edge case handling
6. **Maintainability (10%)**: Code organization, modularity, and ease of modification
7. **Security (5%)**: Proper validation, authentication, and security practices
8. **Performance (5%)**: Efficiency of algorithms and resource usage

### Grade Justification Requirements
- Provide clear rationale for each grade based on specific evidence
- Reference specific files, functions, or patterns as examples
- Explain the impact of identified issues on the overall grade
- Suggest specific improvements to achieve higher grades
