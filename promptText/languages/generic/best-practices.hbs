- Apply language-agnostic best practices systematically
- Assess maintainability, readability, and extensibility
- Identify technical debt and improvement opportunities

### Step 3: Pattern Recognition and Anti-Pattern Detection
- Identify well-implemented design patterns
- Detect anti-patterns and code smells
- Assess architectural consistency
- Evaluate separation of concerns

### Step 4: Risk Assessment and Prioritization
- Evaluate impact and effort for each recommendation
- Assess business risk of current implementation
- Consider maintenance burden and future scalability
- Prioritize recommendations by value and feasibility
