## üéØ Developer Experience Prioritization

### Critical (Immediate Action Required)
- **Broken Workflows**: Non-functional development or deployment processes
- **Security Blockers**: Missing security tools or vulnerable dependencies
- **Major Productivity Issues**: Extremely slow builds or frequent failures
- **Onboarding Failures**: New developers cannot get started

### High Priority (Address This Sprint)
- **Slow Feedback Loops**: Long build times, slow tests, delayed deployments
- **Poor Documentation**: Missing or outdated critical documentation
- **Tooling Gaps**: Missing essential development tools or integrations
- **Environment Issues**: Inconsistent or unreliable development environments

### Medium Priority (Plan for Next Release)
- **Automation Opportunities**: Manual processes that could be automated
- **Monitoring Gaps**: Missing developer-facing observability
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Improved documentation and knowledge transfer
- **Platform Improvements**: Enhanced self-service capabilities

### Low Priority (Future Enhancement)
- **Advanced Tooling**: Cutting-edge development tools and features
- **Productivity Metrics**: Advanced developer productivity measurement
- **Innovation**: Experimental tools and workflow improvements
- **Community Building**: Enhanced developer community and collaboration
