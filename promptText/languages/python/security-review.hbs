# üß† Python Security Code Review

Act as a **security engineer with expertise in Python application security**. Perform a comprehensive security review on the following Python code. Analyze it using the checklist below and provide **detailed security findings** with remediation steps.

{{LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTIONS}}

> **Context**: This is a security-focused review to identify vulnerabilities and security best practice violations in Python code.

## ‚úÖ Python Security Evaluation Checklist

### üîê Authentication & Authorization
- Are authentication mechanisms implemented securely?
- Is authorization properly enforced at all levels?
- Are there any privilege escalation vulnerabilities?
- Is session management implemented securely?
- Are secrets and credentials properly protected?

### üõ°Ô∏è Input Validation & Output Encoding
- Is all user input properly validated and sanitized?
- Are there potential injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, Command, etc.)?
- Are there unsafe uses of `eval()`, `exec()`, `os.system()`, `subprocess.call()`, etc.?
- Is there proper handling of file paths and filenames?
- Are file uploads handled securely?

### üîí Sensitive Data Handling
- Is sensitive data properly encrypted at rest and in transit?
- Are there any hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials?
- Is PII handled according to best practices?
- Are proper hashing algorithms used for passwords (e.g., using bcrypt/Argon2)?
- Are there uses of insecure random number generation?

### üöß Web Security (for web applications)
- Are CSRF protections in place for state-changing operations?
- Is CORS configured securely?
- Are security headers properly implemented?
- Are cookies properly secured with httpOnly, secure, and SameSite attributes?
- Is there protection against common web vulnerabilities?

### üîç Logging & Error Handling
- Are errors handled securely without leaking sensitive information?
- Is logging implemented without capturing sensitive data?
- Are there appropriate audit logs for security-relevant events?
- Are exceptions caught and handled properly?

### üß∞ Dependency Security
- Are there any known vulnerabilities in dependencies?
- Is there a process for updating dependencies with security fixes?
- Are there any insecure or outdated cryptographic libraries?
- Are unsafe serialization/deserialization methods used (pickle, etc.)?

### üîÑ API Security
- Are API endpoints protected against abuse and rate limiting?
- Is proper authentication enforced for all API calls?
- Are there any insecure direct object references?
- Is appropriate input validation performed on API parameters?

### üêç Python-Specific Security Issues
- Are there uses of unsafe Python functions/methods?
- Is there proper handling of subprocess calls?
- Are there YAML/Pickle/Marshal deserialization vulnerabilities?
- Are temporary files handled securely?
- Are there any uses of insecure and deprecated functions?

## üì§ Output Format
Provide clear, structured feedback using a standard vulnerability reporting format:

1. **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of the security posture with key findings

2. **Vulnerability Findings**: For each security issue:
   - **Finding**: Title of the security issue
   - **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low/Informational
   - **Location**: File and line number(s)
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation of the vulnerability
   - **Impact**: What could happen if exploited
   - **Suggested Remediation**: Specific steps to fix the issue with code examples
   - **References**: Links to relevant security standards or documentation

3. **Python-Specific Security Recommendations**: A section focused on Python-specific security improvements

Example remediation for a command injection vulnerability:

```python
# INSECURE: Direct use of user input in shell command
def backup_file(filename):
    os.system(f"cp {filename} /backup/")

# SECURE: Using subprocess with shell=False and argument list
def backup_file(filename):
    import subprocess
    import shlex
    
    # Validate filename against a whitelist or pattern first
    if not re.match(r'^[\w\-\.]+$', filename):
        raise ValueError("Invalid filename")
        
    subprocess.run(["cp", filename, "/backup/"], shell=False, check=True)
```

Focus on actionable security findings with clear remediation steps. Prioritize findings by severity, with special attention to Python-specific vulnerabilities such as insecure deserialization, command injection, and path traversal issues.

NOTE: Your suggestions are for manual implementation by the developer. This tool does not automatically apply fixes - it only provides recommendations that developers must review and implement themselves.
