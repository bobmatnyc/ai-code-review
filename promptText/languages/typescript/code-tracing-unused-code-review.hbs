# Code Path Tracing and Unused Code Detection

I WILL PERFORM comprehensive code path analysis on this codebase. I will:

1. TRACE ALL import paths for each file and function
2. BUILD a complete dependency graph showing exactly what uses what
3. VERIFY which code is actually referenced or executed
4. IDENTIFY with certainty which code can be safely removed

I understand I must DO the code path tracing myself, not merely suggest it. For each element I analyze, I will:

1. SHOW the exact import chain for each module
2. MAP all references across files
3. VERIFY if a function/class is actually called

For duplicate utilities (e.g., when both `/src/utils/X.ts` and `/src/utils/files/X.ts` exist):
- I will ANALYZE which version is actually imported
- I will COUNT references to each version
- I will DETERMINE which should be removed
- I will SPECIFY exact file edits needed

## MY CODE TRACING PROCESS

I will execute this process methodically:

### PASS 1: BUILD THE IMPORT MAP
1. I will scan ALL entry points:
   - package.json main/bin entries
   - index.ts files
   - main.ts, app.ts, server.ts
   - All test files
2. I will map ALL module relationships:
   - I will trace each ES6 import/export
   - I will follow all barrel file re-exports
   - I will track type-only imports
   - I will identify dynamic imports

### PASS 2: TRACE USAGE PATHS
For every exported element:
1. I will find ALL import statements
2. I will count references by file
3. I will map how utility functions flow through the codebase
4. I will specifically trace through:
   - src/utils/index.ts
   - src/utils/files/index.ts
   - src/utils/parsing/index.ts
   - src/utils/api/index.ts
5. I will check for calls to each function
6. I will verify class instantiations
7. I will track JSX component usage

### PASS 3: IDENTIFY DUPLICATE UTILITIES
I will examine closely when I find:
1. Same-named files in different directories
2. Similar functions across utils/ subdirectories
3. I will determine which is:
   - Used more frequently
   - The canonical version
   - Safe to remove

### PASS 4: GENERATE CONCRETE ACTIONS
For each unused element:
1. I will specify EXACTLY what to remove
2. I will list ALL file edits needed
3. I will include precise line numbers
4. I will update affected barrel files
5. I will generate clear removal steps

## WHAT I WILL FIND AND REMOVE

I will focus on these exact issues:

1. **DUPLICATE UTILITY FILES**:
   - Same functionality in multiple locations 
   - Versions in both utils/ and utils/subdirectories

2. **COMPLETELY UNUSED FILES**:
   - .ts files never imported anywhere
   - Barrel files exporting unused elements

3. **DEAD EXPORTS**:
   - Functions exported but never imported
   - Classes/interfaces never referenced
   - Types never used in annotations

4. **REDUNDANT CODE PATHS**:
   - Unreachable conditional blocks
   - Code behind always-false conditions

## MY OUTPUT FORMAT

For each issue, I will provide:

1. **CONCRETE FINDINGS**:
   ```
   DUPLICATE: Found matching utilities:
     - src/utils/projectDocs.ts
     - src/utils/files/projectDocs.ts
   ```

2. **COMPREHENSIVE EVIDENCE**:
   ```
   IMPORTS TRACED:
     - src/utils/projectDocs.ts: 0 direct imports
     - src/utils/files/projectDocs.ts: 5 imports via barrel file
   
   BARREL FILE ANALYSIS:
     - src/utils/index.ts: exports { projectDocs } from './projectDocs'
     - src/utils/files/index.ts: exports { projectDocs } from './projectDocs'
   
   REFERENCES:
     - Only the files/ version is imported by application code
     - The utils/ version is only imported by its duplicate
   ```

3. **EXACT ACTIONS TO TAKE**:
   ```
   REQUIRED CHANGES:
     1. REMOVE file: src/utils/projectDocs.ts
     2. EDIT file: src/utils/index.ts
        - REMOVE line: export { projectDocs } from './projectDocs'
     3. EDIT file: src/utils/files/projectDocs.ts 
        - REMOVE import { projectDocs as baseProjectDocs } from '../index'
        - ADD any functionality from original file
   ```

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST - I MUST DO ALL OF THESE

1. ✅ CHECK FOR FILE PAIRS:
   - Search for duplicate files with same name in different directories
   - Compare content and functionality
   - Verify which is imported where

2. ✅ COMPLETE IMPORT CHAIN ANALYSIS:
   - Follow ALL imports through barrel files
   - Map EVERY import statement in the codebase
   - Count exact references to each utility

3. ✅ EXAMINE CODE DEPENDENCIES:
   - Find which files ACTUALLY use each function
   - Check if a utility only exists to support a removed feature
   - Verify circular dependencies

4. ✅ HANDLE TYPESCRIPT-SPECIFIC CASES:
   - Type-only imports
   - Interface inheritance 
   - Type annotations
   - Generic constraints

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT

```
===== DUPLICATE UTILITY DETECTION =====

DUPLICATE: Found duplicate utilities:
  - src/utils/projectDocs.ts  
  - src/utils/files/projectDocs.ts

IMPORT TRACING RESULTS:
  • src/utils/projectDocs.ts:
    - EXPORTED BY: src/utils/index.ts
    - DIRECT IMPORTS: 0 files
    - INDIRECT IMPORTS: 1 file (only by its duplicate)
  
  • src/utils/files/projectDocs.ts:
    - EXPORTED BY: src/utils/files/index.ts
    - DIRECT IMPORTS: 0 files
    - BARREL IMPORTS: 5 files
      1. src/commands/reviewCode.ts
      2. src/core/ReviewGenerator.ts
      3. src/handlers/architecturalReviewHandler.ts
      4. src/handlers/consolidatedReviewHandler.ts
      5. src/prompts/PromptBuilder.ts

CODE PATH VERIFICATION:
  • CONFIRMED: Only the files/ version is used by application code
  • FOUND: The duplicate imports from the original
  • VERIFIED: All functionality can be consolidated in files/ version

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
  1. REMOVE file src/utils/projectDocs.ts
  2. EDIT src/utils/index.ts:
     - Remove: export { projectDocs } from './projectDocs'
  3. EDIT src/utils/files/projectDocs.ts:
     - Remove: import { projectDocs as baseProjectDocs } from '../index'
     - Add any unique functionality from the original file

CONFIDENCE: HIGH - Clear evidence shows only files/ version is used
```

I will ONLY focus on code path tracing and unused code identification. I will NOT include style suggestions, refactoring ideas, or any advice unrelated to dead code removal.
