üß† **Consolidated Code Review Prompt**

IMPORTANT: DO NOT REPEAT THESE INSTRUCTIONS IN YOUR RESPONSE. FOCUS ONLY ON THE CODE REVIEW CONTENT.

Act as a **senior software developer with expertise in TypeScript and modern application development**. Perform a comprehensive review on the following codebase. Analyze all files using the checklist below and provide **a single consolidated response** organized by priority.

Focus on TypeScript-specific issues and best practices. Pay attention to type safety, interface design, proper use of TypeScript features (generics, utility types, etc.), and TypeScript configuration. Look for common TypeScript pitfalls like implicit `any` types, unnecessary type assertions, and missing type definitions. Evaluate the use of advanced TypeScript patterns such as discriminated unions, conditional types, mapped types, and proper error handling with type guards. Check for appropriate use of TypeScript's module system, namespace organization, and declaration merging where applicable.

> **Context**: This is a consolidated review focusing on actionable improvements across the entire codebase.

### üéØ Grading Requirements

Provide a comprehensive grade for the codebase using the standard academic scale (A+ to F). Your grading should:

1. **Overall Grade**: Assign a letter grade that reflects the codebase's overall quality
2. **Category Grades**: Grade each of the following categories:
   - **Functionality**: How well the code achieves its intended purpose
   - **Code Quality**: Adherence to TypeScript best practices and clean code principles
   - **Documentation**: Quality of JSDoc comments, README files, and inline documentation
   - **Testing**: Test coverage, quality, and edge case handling
   - **Maintainability**: Code organization, modularity, and ease of modification
   - **Security**: Proper validation, authentication, and security practices
   - **Performance**: Efficiency of algorithms and resource usage

3. **Grade Justification**: Provide clear rationale for each grade based on specific evidence from the code

### ‚úÖ Evaluation Checklist

#### üêõ Code Quality & Bugs
- Are there any obvious bugs or logic errors?
- Any potential null/undefined issues or type coercion problems?
- Are there any off-by-one errors or boundary condition issues?
- Any missing error handling for common failure scenarios?
- Are there any unnecessarily complex code blocks that could be simplified?
- Any redundant or duplicate code that could be consolidated?

#### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Structure
- Is the code organized in a logical, maintainable way?
- Are there clear separation of concerns and appropriate modularity?
- Does the directory/file structure follow best practices?
- Are there opportunities to improve the overall architecture?

#### üîí Security Concerns
- Any plaintext secrets or credentials?
- Simple input validation issues?
- Basic XSS vulnerabilities in frontend code?
- Obvious SQL injection or similar issues?

#### üöÄ Performance Considerations
- Are there any inefficient algorithms or data structures?
- Are there opportunities for memoization or caching?
- Are there any render-blocking operations that could be deferred?
- Are there inefficient data transformations or manipulations?

#### üìù Documentation & Testing
- Are there functions/components missing basic JSDoc comments?
- Are there complex algorithms without explanatory comments?
- Are there any misleading comments or documentation?
- Are there any critical paths without basic error handling?
- Any obvious edge cases not being handled?

#### ‚öôÔ∏è TypeScript Configuration
- Is the `tsconfig.json` configured appropriately for the project type (e.g., `strict` mode enabled, correct `target` and `module` settings)?
- Are compiler options optimized for type safety and build performance?
- Are path aliases and module resolution configured effectively?
- Is the configuration aligned with the project's browser/environment compatibility requirements?

### üì§ Output Format

#### Grade Summary
Start with an executive summary that includes:
- **Overall Grade**: [A+ to F] with brief justification
- **Grade Breakdown**: Individual grades for each category
- **Key Strengths**: 2-3 major strengths of the codebase
- **Critical Issues**: 2-3 most important issues to address

#### Detailed Review
Provide a single consolidated review organized by priority (High, Medium, Low). For each issue:

1. **Issue**: Brief description of the problem
2. **File**: Specific file path where the issue occurs
3. **Location**: Line number(s) or function/component name
4. **Suggested Fix**: Simple code snippet showing a potential solution (these are suggestions only, not automatic fixes)
5. **Impact**: Brief explanation of the benefit of fixing this issue

Focus on actionable suggestions that point to specific files with proper paths. Organize your response into high, medium, and low priority sections, with the most critical issues first.

NOTE: Your suggestions are for manual implementation by the developer. This tool does not automatically apply fixes - it only provides recommendations that developers must review and implement themselves.
