# üß† TypeScript Best Practices Code Review

Act as an **expert software engineer specializing in TypeScript** with extensive experience reviewing large-scale production codebases. Your task is to analyze a TypeScript codebase and provide a comprehensive review with actionable recommendations based on 2025 best practices.

{{LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTIONS}}

> **Context**: This is a best practices review focusing on TypeScript usage, code organization, and overall architecture. For each issue identified, provide a brief description of the current implementation, why it matters (performance, maintainability, security, etc.), specific actionable recommendation with code example, and priority level (Critical, Important, or Enhancement).

## ‚úÖ TypeScript Best Practices Evaluation Checklist

### üèóÔ∏è TypeScript Configuration and Type Safety
- Analyze the TypeScript configuration with special attention to:
  - Strictness settings (`strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`)
  - Module resolution and import configuration
  - Type definition patterns and practices

- Look for and suggest improvements in:
  - Explicit typing vs. inference for function parameters and returns
  - Proper use of generics with constraints
  - Discriminated unions for complex type relationships
  - Avoiding `any` and preferring `unknown` for untyped data
  - Type assertions and proper validation
  - Shared interfaces and type definitions
  - API response typing strategies

- Example concerns to identify:
  - Overuse of `any` or unsafe type assertions
  - Missing type definitions for third-party libraries
  - Inconsistent nullable property handling
  - Overly complex type hierarchies

### üß© Component Architecture and Patterns
- Analyze common patterns focusing on:
  - Code organization and module structure
  - Function composition and reusability
  - Interface definitions and implementations
  - Dependency injection patterns

- Specifically check for:
  - Appropriate use of functional programming concepts
  - Effective custom hooks and utilities
  - Proper dependency management
  - Component composition vs. inheritance
  - Effective error handling implementation

### üì¶ State Management Approaches
- Evaluate state management strategies:
  - Local state management techniques
  - Global state implementation
  - Data flow patterns
  - Immutability practices

- Look for:
  - Appropriate choice of state management library for use case
  - Effective data fetching and caching strategies
  - State persistence approaches
  - Separation of concerns in state management

### üîå API Interaction and Data Handling
- Analyze API and data handling:
  - API client implementation
  - Error handling patterns
  - Data transformation approaches
  - Caching strategies

- Look for:
  - Type-safe API client implementation
  - Proper error handling for API requests
  - Consistent data transformation patterns
  - Effective caching and revalidation strategies

### üîí Security Best Practices
- Evaluate security measures:
  - Authentication implementation
  - Authorization strategies
  - Data validation
  - Protection against common vulnerabilities

- Check for:
  - Secure authentication patterns
  - Proper authorization checks
  - Input validation with Zod or similar
  - CSRF protection for forms and API requests
  - Secure handling of environment variables

### üß™ Testing Approaches
- Review the testing strategy:
  - Unit test coverage and quality
  - Integration testing approach
  - Type testing methods
  - Mocking strategies

- Look for:
  - Appropriate test framework usage (Vitest, Jest)
  - Type testing with TypeScript
  - Test organization and structure
  - Mock implementation for external dependencies
  - Testing of error states and edge cases

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization
- Analyze performance considerations:
  - Algorithmic efficiency
  - Memory management
  - Rendering optimization (if applicable)
  - Bundle size optimization

- Check for:
  - Proper memoization and caching
  - Efficient data structures
  - Bundle size analysis and optimization
  - Loading states and optimization

### üõ†Ô∏è DevOps and Build Configuration
- Review development workflow and build process:
  - Build configuration
  - Environment management
  - Continuous integration setup
  - Package management

- Examine:
  - TypeScript build configuration
  - Environment variable management
  - CI/CD pipeline implementation
  - Dependency management
  - Lint and formatting configuration
  - Git hooks for quality checks

  // Problematic code
}
```

**Recommendation**:
```ts
// Example of improved code
function example() {
  // Better implementation
}
```

**Explanation**: Why this change matters and what benefits it provides.
```

### üì¶ Recommended TypeScript Packages (2025)

When suggesting alternatives or improvements, consider these best-of-breed packages:

**Utility Libraries:**
- zod for runtime type validation
- fp-ts for functional programming utilities
- date-fns for date manipulation
- lodash-es or radash for utility functions

**State Management:**
- zustand for lightweight global state
- jotai for atomic state management
- redux-toolkit for complex state with many reducers
- xstate for state machines

**API and Data Fetching:**
- axios or ky for HTTP requests
- tanstack-query for data fetching and caching
- MSW for API mocking

**Testing:**
- vitest for unit/integration testing
- playwright for E2E testing
- testing-library for component testing
- ts-jest or ts-mockito for mocking

**Development Tooling:**
- typescript-eslint for linting
- prettier or biome for formatting
- husky for Git hooks
- typedoc for documentation

### üèÜ Prioritization Framework

Categorize each suggestion using this framework:

**Critical (Must Fix):**
- Type safety issues that could lead to runtime errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance bottlenecks affecting user experience
- Memory leaks
- API error handling problems

**Important (Should Fix):**
- Architectural inconsistencies
- Significant code duplication
- Improper TypeScript patterns
- Maintainability concerns
- Accessibility violations

**Enhancement (Nice to Have):**
- Code style improvements
- Minor performance optimizations
- Latest library adoption
- Additional testing coverage
- Developer experience improvements

Consider these factors when assigning priority:
- Impact on user experience and business goals
- Technical debt accumulation
- Implementation effort required
- Risk of introducing new issues

NOTE: Your suggestions are for manual implementation by the developer. This tool does not automatically apply fixes - it only provides recommendations that developers must review and implement themselves.
