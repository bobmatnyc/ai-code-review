# 🧠 PHP Security Code Review

Act as a **security engineer with expertise in PHP application security**. Perform a comprehensive security review on the following PHP code. Analyze it using the checklist below and provide **detailed security findings** with remediation steps.

{{LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTIONS}}

> **Context**: This is a security-focused review to identify vulnerabilities and security best practice violations in PHP code.

## ✅ PHP Security Evaluation Checklist

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- Are authentication mechanisms implemented securely?
- Is authorization properly enforced at all levels?
- Are there any privilege escalation vulnerabilities?
- Is session management implemented securely (session_start, session variables)?
- Are password hashing functions secure (password_hash vs md5/sha1)?

### 🛡️ Input Validation & Output Encoding
- Is all user input properly validated and sanitized?
- Are there potential injection vulnerabilities (SQL, Command, etc.)?
- Is output properly encoded to prevent XSS (htmlspecialchars, etc.)?
- Are there insecure uses of eval(), shell_exec(), system(), etc.?
- Are file uploads handled securely?

### 🔒 Sensitive Data Handling
- Is sensitive data properly encrypted at rest and in transit?
- Are there any hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials?
- Is PII handled according to best practices?
- Are proper hashing algorithms used for passwords?
- Is there proper implementation of encryption functions?

### 🚧 CSRF & CORS
- Are CSRF protections in place for state-changing operations?
- Is CORS configured securely?
- Are security headers properly implemented?
- Are cookies properly secured with httpOnly, secure, and SameSite attributes?

### 🔍 Logging & Error Handling
- Are errors handled securely without leaking sensitive information?
- Is error_reporting properly configured in production?
- Is logging implemented without capturing sensitive data?
- Are there appropriate audit logs for security-relevant events?

### 🧰 Dependency Security
- Are there any known vulnerabilities in dependencies (Composer packages)?
- Is there a process for updating dependencies with security fixes?
- Are there any insecure third-party libraries?

### 🔄 API Security
- Are API endpoints protected against abuse and rate limiting?
- Is proper authentication enforced for all API calls?
- Are there any insecure direct object references?
- Is appropriate input validation performed on API parameters?

### 🐘 PHP-Specific Security Issues
- Are there any uses of insecure PHP functions (extract, parse_str without arguments)?
- Is register_globals disabled?
- Are file permissions set properly?
- Is there proper handling of file inclusion (require/include)?
- Are there any insecure deserialization vulnerabilities (unserialize)?
- Are $_SERVER, $_GET, $_POST variables used safely?

## 📤 Output Format
Provide clear, structured feedback using a standard vulnerability reporting format:

1. **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of the security posture with key findings

2. **Vulnerability Findings**: For each security issue:
   - **Finding**: Title of the security issue
   - **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low/Informational
   - **Location**: File and line number(s)
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation of the vulnerability
   - **Impact**: What could happen if exploited
   - **Suggested Remediation**: Specific steps to fix the issue with code examples
   - **References**: Links to relevant security standards or documentation

3. **PHP-Specific Security Recommendations**: A section focused on PHP-specific security improvements

Example remediation for a SQL injection vulnerability:

```php
// INSECURE: Direct concatenation of user input
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $_POST['username'] . "'";
$result = $mysqli->query($query);

// SECURE: Using prepared statements
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $_POST['username']);
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();
```

Focus on actionable security findings with clear remediation steps. Prioritize findings by severity, with special attention to PHP-specific vulnerabilities like insecure deserialization, file inclusion issues, and dangerous function usage.

NOTE: Your suggestions are for manual implementation by the developer. This tool does not automatically apply fixes - it only provides recommendations that developers must review and implement themselves.
