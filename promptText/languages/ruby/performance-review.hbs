## ✅ Ruby/Rails Performance Evaluation Checklist

### 💾 Database Performance
- Identify N+1 query problems
- Check for missing database indexes
- Review complex or inefficient queries
- Identify opportunities for eager loading with `includes`, `preload`, or `eager_load`
- Check for proper use of database transactions
- Review use of counter caches vs. COUNT queries
- Identify places where batch processing could be used
- Check for proper connection pool configuration
- Review schema design for performance issues

### 🔍 ActiveRecord Optimizations
- Check for inefficient use of ActiveRecord methods
- Identify places to use `find_each` or `in_batches` for large datasets
- Review scope definitions for efficiency
- Check for unused or redundant database columns
- Identify places to use `pluck` or `select` to limit data retrieval
- Review proper use of callbacks with performance implications
- Check for opportunities to use raw SQL when appropriate
- Identify places to leverage methods like `exists?` over `present?`

### 🧮 Memory Optimization
- Identify memory leaks or excessive memory usage
- Check for proper use of garbage collection
- Review large object allocations
- Identify string allocations that could be optimized
- Check for excessive use of instance variables
- Review eager loading vs. lazy loading strategies
- Check for proper caching of expensive computations

### 📦 Caching Strategies
- Identify missing or inefficient cache usage
- Review cache invalidation strategies
- Check for opportunities to use fragment caching
- Identify places to use Russian Doll caching
- Review use of `cache_key` and `touch`
- Check for proper cache store configuration
- Identify places to use counter caching
- Review HTTP caching headers and strategies

### 🔄 Background Processing
- Check for operations that should be moved to background jobs
- Review job queue configuration
- Identify inefficient background job patterns
- Check for proper use of ActiveJob
- Review batch processing opportunities
- Check for proper error handling in background jobs

### 💎 Ruby-Specific Optimizations
- Identify inefficient Ruby code patterns
- Review string manipulations for performance
- Check for inefficient use of Ruby's Enumerable methods
- Identify places where custom methods could be more efficient
- Review recursive algorithms for performance improvements
- Check for proper use of Ruby's GC tuning options
- Identify opportunities to use more efficient data structures

### 🧰 Rails-Specific Optimizations
- Review asset pipeline or Webpacker configuration
- Check for proper configuration of development vs. production environments
- Identify places to use non-blocking I/O
- Review middleware stack for unnecessary components
- Check for proper routing configuration
- Identify potential for HTTP/2 optimizations
- Review proper use of ActiveSupport instrumentation

## 📤 Output Format

1. **Executive Summary**: Overview of key performance findings and recommendations

2. **Performance Issues by Impact**: Grouped by severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
   For each performance issue found, include:
   - **Issue Description**: A clear description of the performance problem
   - **Location**: File, class, method, and line numbers affected
   - **Severity**: Based on performance impact
   - **Current Implementation**: The current inefficient code
   - **Performance Impact**: How this affects system performance (memory, CPU, database, etc.)
   - **Optimization Suggestion**: Specific code changes or approaches to improve performance
   - **Expected Improvement**: The estimated performance benefit from implementing the suggestion
   - **Profiling Hints**: How to measure the performance before and after the optimization

3. **Ruby/Rails-Specific Performance Recommendations**: A section focused on Ruby/Rails-specific optimizations

Example optimization:

```ruby
# BEFORE: N+1 query problem
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
    
    # N+1 query - for each post, a separate query is made to fetch comments
    @posts_with_comments = @posts.map do |post|
      { post: post, comments: post.comments }
    end
  end
end

# AFTER: Using eager loading to avoid N+1 query
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.includes(:comments).all
    
    # No N+1 query - comments are eager loaded with posts
    @posts_with_comments = @posts.map do |post|
      { post: post, comments: post.comments }
    end
  end
end
```

## Ruby/Rails-Specific Performance Focus Areas

### Rails Request Lifecycle
- Check for inefficient before_action callbacks in controllers
- Identify slow initializers
- Review middleware that could be affecting performance
- Check for inefficient route constraints or custom routing logic

### View Rendering
- Identify slow partials that could be cached
- Review collection rendering for efficiency
- Check for proper use of `content_for` and `yield`
- Identify places where JSON generation could be optimized
- Review template rendering strategies

### Third-Party Integrations
- Check for synchronous API calls that could be asynchronous
- Review HTTP client configurations
- Identify missing timeout settings
- Check for inefficient third-party gem usage
- Review webhook processing methods

Focus on providing actionable, specific recommendations that offer the best performance improvements for the least development effort. Prioritize issues by their potential performance impact.

NOTE: Your suggestions are for manual implementation by the developer. This tool does not automatically apply fixes - it only provides recommendations that developers must review and implement themselves.
