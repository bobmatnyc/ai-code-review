## üîß Core Principles
### ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Always implement using modern, community-validated best practices.
- Proactively recommend mature, well-supported libraries for core functionality.
- Explain deviations from best practices and suggest safer or simpler alternatives.

### üåü Simplicity and Elegance

- Prioritize simplicity and clarity in all solutions.
- Choose the minimal working implementation over complex abstractions‚Äîespecially for MVPs or POCs.
- Confirm with the user if a request risks over-engineering.

### üîê Confirmation & Safety

- Confirm explicitly before changing behavior, logic, or architecture.
- Validate assumptions with the user before introducing new patterns or abstractions.

### üìù Documentation

- Document _intent_, not just behavior, for complex or non-obvious logic.
- All functions must include JSDoc with TypeScript annotations.
- Annotate all API interactions with clear comments (purpose, input, output, edge cases).
- Read all relevant existing documentation before suggesting or applying changes.

## üß™ Code Quality & Workflow

### üî≠ Development Flow

- Run linting and typechecking after all changes‚Äînon-negotiable.
- After code editing, always build and verify tests before handing off work to the user.
- Ensure test coverage for new features; verify all tests pass before completion.
- Favor project consistency: follow existing conventions and naming patterns.
- Optimize for clarity, maintainability, and fast onboarding.
- Simpler is better‚Äîprefer straightforward implementations when in doubt.

### üéÆ Playground Apps

- Use real package functionality unless mocks are explicitly required.
- Demonstrate real-world usage scenarios.
- Apply the same testing and quality standards as production features.
- Document test configurations or overrides clearly.

### üåê API Integration

- Use structured error handling for all external requests.
- Respect API token budgeting and performance best practices.
- Manage environment variables via `.env`, supporting `.env.local` (e.g., in Next.js).
- Never hardcode secrets or keys.

### üîÑ Automation Support

- Use pre-commit hooks to enforce linting, formatting, and type safety.
- Integrate CI to run all tests and checks before merging.
- Document any custom Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, squash merging).

### üö© Feature Flags and Experimental Code

- Wrap experimental or in-progress features in flags or annotations.
- Clearly label blocks that are incomplete or need validation.
- Use TODO/FIXME comments to prompt human follow-up.

### ü§î Testing Standards

- Unit tests required for all core logic and utilities.
- Integration tests for API services or multi-component flows.
- Use mocks/stubs only when external dependencies are involved.
- Prefer `Vitest`, `Jest`, or the project's default test runner.
- All tests must pass with >80% coverage unless justified.

## üìö Documentation System

### File Roles

- `README.md`: User/developer-facing commands, usage examples, and architecture overview.
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md`: AI assistant directives (this document).
- `PROJECT.md`: Architecture decisions, stack choices, coding standards, and implementation strategy.
- `PROGRESS.md`: Session logs with status, blockers, tasks, and commits. Includes TODOS from ongoing work.
- `ABOUT.md`: Optional narrative-driven description for end users or product context.
- `VERSIONS.md`: Version history, features, and technical improvements.

### üé´ GitHub Issues Management

- **Reading Issues**: Use the GitHub API to fetch issues from the repository.
- **Creating Issues**: Create well-structured issues with clear titles, descriptions, and appropriate labels.
- **Updating Issues**: Update existing issues with new information, status changes, or additional context.
- **Labels**: Always use appropriate labels when creating or updating issues:
  - `bug`: For issues that represent bugs or defects
  - `enhancement`: For feature requests or improvements
  - `documentation`: For documentation-related tasks
  - `question`: For issues that are questions or need clarification
  - `good first issue`: For issues suitable for newcomers
  - `help wanted`: For issues where external help is desired
  - `wontfix`: For issues that won't be addressed
  - `duplicate`: For issues that duplicate existing ones
  - `invalid`: For issues that are not valid or relevant

Note: Users will manually add issues to projects using the GitHub web UI as needed.

### üìÑ Updating `PROJECT.md`

Update this file when any of the following occur:

- Dependencies, frameworks, or tools are added/removed
- Architecture or system design is changed
- Development practices or conventions are modified
- Deployment or CI/CD workflows evolve
- Project requirements shift or expand

> **Each update must:**
>
> - Be timestamped (e.g., `// Updated: 2025-04-04`)
> - Maintain chronological order within its section

---

### üìà Managing `PROGRESS.md`

At the start of every session, add a dated header:

- Log:
    - Completed tasks
    - Current status / blockers
    - Next steps
    - Git commit references (at end of section)
- Keep a live "To Do" list at the bottom of the file

---

### üîÅ Log Rotation Policy

When `PROGRESS.md` exceeds 1000 lines or at the end of the month:

1. Archive the current file:

   ```bash
   LATEST=$(ls -1 /logs/PROGRESS-*.md | sort -V | tail -1 | sed 's/.*PROGRESS-\([0-9]*\).*/\1/')
   NEXT=$((LATEST + 1))
   cp PROGRESS.md /logs/PROGRESS-$NEXT.md
   ```

2. Start a fresh `PROGRESS.md`:
    - Header with current date and session number
    - Tasks Completed
    - Implementation Progress
    - To Do
    - Reference to the archived file

## üß† Summary

Build with rigor. Document with clarity. Validate assumptions. Prioritize simplicity and elegance. Treat this assistant as a collaborator, not a script.
