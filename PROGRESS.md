# Project Progress Log

## 2024-04-13 - Version 1.9.4 (In Development)

### Summary
We've integrated LangChain into the prompt management system to provide more powerful prompt templating, chaining, and optimization capabilities. This integration allows for structured outputs, few-shot prompting, and better prompt development workflows. Additionally, we've added a new "unused code" review type that uses LangChain to identify dead code that can be safely removed, and then further improved it with enhanced prompts and schema definitions.

### Completed Tasks
- Added LangChain dependency for enhanced prompt management
- Created a LangChain-specific prompt strategy implementation
- Added LangChain utility functions for creating prompt templates and parsers
- Integrated with existing prompt strategy system
- Created examples demonstrating LangChain usage
- Added a new "unused-code" review type for identifying and removing dead code
- Created Zod schemas for structured output of unused code review results
- Improved the unused code review with enhanced prompts and detailed schemas
- Added few-shot learning examples for better unused code detection
- Created TypeScript-specific templates for improved static analysis

2. Updated prompt templates to emphasize finding entirely unused elements
3. Enhanced schema with new categories for unused files, functions, classes, and modules
4. Restructured formatter to separate unused files from functions for better clarity
5. Improved removal script generator to handle entire files and functions
6. Added safeguards for generated removal scripts with clear git-based recovery instructions

7. Added support for TypeScript-specific detection of unused interfaces and types

#### Improved Quick Fixes Review
1. Enhanced the quick fixes review with LangChain integration
2. Created a detailed schema for structured output using Zod

### Summary
Today we made significant improvements to the code review tool by adding project documentation to the AI context and updating to the Gemini 2.5 Max model. We also fixed environment variable handling and implemented structured version numbering.

### Completed Tasks
- Fixed API key handling to remove hardcoded keys from the codebase
- Updated command structure to use `yarn dev code-review [project] [file|directory]`
- Improved environment variable loading from .env.local
- Added support for both GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_KEY and GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_KEY (prioritizing GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_KEY)
- Enhanced error handling and debugging for environment variable loading
- Updated to use available Gemini AI models with robust fallback mechanism based on official documentation
- Added model testing utility to verify model availability
- Added support for gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 model using v1beta API
- Confirmed gemini-2.0-flash and gemini-1.5-pro are available as fallbacks
- Implemented proper API calls with configuration parameters for better results
- Added support for including project documentation (README.md, PROJECT.md, PROGRESS.md) in the AI context
- Created utility functions to read and format project documentation
- Added a new command-line option to control project documentation inclusion
- Updated documentation in README.md and .env.example
- Updated PROJECT.md with the latest changes
- Created VERSION.md with structured version history
- Updated version to 0.9.0 across the codebase
- Added support for reviewing the current project using 'self' or '.' as the project name

### Implementation Details

#### Project Documentation Context
We implemented a new feature to include project documentation in the AI context:

1. Created a new utility module `src/utils/projectDocs.ts` with functions:
   - `readProjectDocs()`: Reads README.md, PROJECT.md, and PROGRESS.md files
   - `formatProjectDocs()`: Formats the documentation for inclusion in the prompt

2. Modified the prompt generation in `geminiClient.ts` to include the documentation

3. Added a new command-line option `--include-project-docs` (enabled by default)

This enhancement provides the AI model with more context about the project, which should result in more accurate and relevant code reviews.

#### Environment Variable Handling
We improved the environment variable handling to be more robust:

1. Removed hardcoded API key from the codebase
2. Added support for both environment variable names for backward compatibility
3. Enhanced error messages and debugging information
4. Added fallback to `.env` when `.env.local` is not found

#### Model Fallback Mechanism
We implemented a fallback mechanism for Gemini AI models based on the official Google AI documentation:

1. First tries to use gemini-1.5-pro which has good capabilities
2. Falls back to gemini-pro if 1.5-pro is not available
3. Finally tries gemini-pro-latest as a last resort
4. Uses try-catch blocks to handle model initialization errors
5. Provides clear console messages about which model is being used
6. Updated all documentation to use generic "Gemini AI" references
7. Implemented proper API calls with configuration parameters:
   - Set temperature to 0.2 for more focused code reviews
   - Set maxOutputTokens to 8192 for detailed reviews
   - Added safety settings to comply with API requirements
   - Used the proper content structure with roles and parts

#### Version Numbering
We implemented structured version numbering following semantic versioning principles:

1. Created VERSION.md to track version history
2. Started with version 0.9.0 for the current implementation
3. Backfilled previous versions with work to date, grouped logically
4. Updated version number in package.json and src/index.ts
5. Documented version changes in a structured format (Added, Changed, Fixed)

### Current Status
- Environment variable handling is now more robust
- Command structure matches the requirements
- Documentation is up-to-date
- Project documentation (README.md, PROJECT.md, PROGRESS.md) is now included in AI context
- Using available Gemini AI models with robust fallback mechanism based on official documentation
