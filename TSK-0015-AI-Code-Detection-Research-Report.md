import ast

def calculate_code_entropy(code_text):
    """Calculate Shannon entropy for code patterns"""
    # Tokenize code elements
    try:
        tree = ast.parse(code_text)
        tokens = []
        for node in ast.walk(tree):
            if isinstance(node, ast.Name):
                tokens.append(f"var_{node.id}")

    # Calculate frequency distribution
    freq_dist = Counter(tokens)
    total_tokens = sum(freq_dist.values())
    
    # Calculate entropy
    entropy = 0
    for count in freq_dist.values():

def detect_ai_patterns(code_entropy, threshold=5.0):
    """Detect AI patterns based on entropy threshold"""
    # Lower entropy suggests more predictable/uniform patterns

    messagePatterns: commits.map(c => c.message),
    fileCreationBatch: false,
    commitSizes: commits.map(c => c.changedFiles.length)
  };

  // Check for simultaneous file creation
  const initialCommit = commits[0];
  if (initialCommit && initialCommit.changedFiles.length > 10) {
    analysis.fileCreationBatch = true;
  }

  // Analyze commit message uniformity
  const messageStructureSimilarity = calculateMessageSimilarity(
    analysis.messagePatterns
  );

  // Check for regular timing patterns
  const timingRegularity = analyzeCommitTiming(analysis.timestamps);

  return {
    confidence: calculateConfidence([
      analysis.fileCreationBatch ? 0.8 : 0.2,
      messageStructureSimilarity,
      timingRegularity
    ]),
    patterns: analysis
  };
}
```

interface DocumentationMetrics {
  commentDensity: number;
  structureUniformity: number;
  vocabularyDiversity: number;
  templateLikeness: number;
}

function analyzeDocumentationPatterns(
  codebase: string[]
): DocumentationMetrics {
  
  // Calculate comment density across files
  const commentDensity = codebase.reduce((acc, file) => {
    const lines = file.split('\n');
    const commentLines = lines.filter(line => 
      line.trim().startsWith('//') || 
      line.trim().startsWith('/*') ||
      line.trim().startsWith('*')
    );
    return acc + (commentLines.length / lines.length);
  }, 0) / codebase.length;

  // Analyze README structure if present
  const readmeFile = codebase.find(file => 
    file.includes('# ') || file.includes('## ')
  );
  
  let structureUniformity = 0;
  if (readmeFile) {
    const sections = readmeFile.match(/^#+\s+.+$/gm) || [];
