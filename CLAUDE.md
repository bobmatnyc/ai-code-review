## Instructions Review Protocol

When starting, I will:

1. **Carefully review** all instructions from INSTRUCTIONS.md
2. **Understand** the project context from PROJECT.md  
3. **Confirm adherence** to all coding standards and preferences
4. **Apply** these guidelines consistently throughout our session

## Key Reminders

- **ALWAYS** follow the coding standards specified in INSTRUCTIONS.md
- **NEVER** proceed without considering project context from PROJECT.md
- **ASK** for clarification if instructions conflict with requests
- **MAINTAIN** consistency with established patterns and conventions

## Session Start Checklist

Before beginning any task, confirm:
- [ ] Instructions from INSTRUCTIONS.md are loaded and understood

## Error Prevention
