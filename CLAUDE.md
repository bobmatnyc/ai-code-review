# Claude Code Instructions

## CRITICAL: Review Required Documentation
**IMPORTANT**: Before starting any work, you MUST review these files:
1. `/docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Core development instructions
2. `/docs/WORKFLOW.md` - Required workflow processes
3. `/docs/PROJECT.md` - Project specifications and requirements (if exists)

**Following these instructions is MANDATORY. Ask for clarification before considering ANY variance from the documented procedures.**

## Development Guidelines
- Always run lint and typecheck before completing tasks
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- **NEVER deviate from documented instructions without explicit approval**
